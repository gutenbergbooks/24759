<h2>PREFACE.</h2>


<p>There is nothing new in the following pages;
except it be that they call popular attention to
facts which have been commonly recognised
only by scholars.</p>

<p>But I am aware that their contents will appear
novel to many; and to remove this idea
some extracts are here given from the Commentaries
in general use.</p>

<p>1. Bishop Wordsworth on S. Matt. xiii. 3;
&ldquo;This chapter may be described as containing
a Divine Treatise on the Church Militant here
on earth.&rdquo;</p>

<p>2. Dean Alford on S. Matt. xiii. 52; &ldquo;The
seven Parables compose in their inner depth of
connexion, a great united whole, beginning with
the first sowing of the Church, and ending with
the consummation.&rdquo;</p>

<p>3. The Speaker&rsquo;s Commentary on S. Matt.
iii. 2; &ldquo;It&mdash;the Kingdom of Heaven&mdash;signifies
the promised Kingdom of the Messiah. Hence
the expectation of the Messiah is spoken of as
a <em>waiting for the Kingdom of God</em>. Our Lord,
adopts the expression and frequently employs
it to denote His Spiritual Kingdom the Church.&rdquo;</p>

<p>4. Bishop Walsham How (S. P. C. K. Commentary)
on S. Matt. iii. 2; &ldquo;It&mdash;the Kingdom
of Heaven&mdash;is generally used to signify the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[Pg&nbsp;4]</a></span>
Kingdom of Christ on earth, the Kingdom of
the Gospel, the Church of Christ.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I desire also to remove by anticipation a fear
that some may feel, lest, in regarding the Gospel
as being the good news of the Kingdom of
Heaven, the great doctrine of the Atonement
should be forgotten. Such an idea is refuted
by the words of Holy Scripture. For not only
is the Preaching of our Blessed Lord, before He
suffered, thus described&mdash;see S. Mark i. 14&mdash;but
also the teaching of S. Paul, in later years,
who gloried in knowing only &ldquo;Jesus Christ and
Him crucified&rdquo;&mdash;see Acts xx. 25.</p>

<p>My object has been to provide an answer to
two questions.</p>

<p>1. What did our Blessed Lord teach about
His Church in His discourses?</p>

<p>2. What is meant by the words of the Creed,
&ldquo;The Holy Catholic Church; the Communion
of Saints?&rdquo;</p>

<p>May these pages help men to gain an intelligent
knowledge of that Kingdom, into which
our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ has called us.
May they lead many to desire the fulfilment of
His last prayer for us before His Passion, &ldquo;That
they all may be one.&rdquo; And may every word in
this little book, which is not in accordance with
God&rsquo;s will, be pardoned, and overruled to His
Glory.</p>

<p>When the Saviour of the world was about to
enter upon His public ministry, the Jewish
nation was startled with the cry, &ldquo;The Kingdom
of Heaven is at hand&rdquo; (S. Matt. iii. 2).</p>

<p>Such was God&rsquo;s call to His people of old
time, to prepare themselves to take part in the
fulfilment of the promises, on which their faith
and hopes were founded. The fulness of the
times had come; and Christ, the long-promised
and long-expected Saviour and King, was nigh
at hand.</p>

<p>And ever since that day, as the good news of
the Kingdom has spread from land to land, it
has been the portion of the Lord&rsquo;s people to
endeavour to realise their high position in that
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg&nbsp;8]</a></span>
Kingdom, and to discharge their duties loyally
to their Heavenly King.</p>

<p>But the words&mdash;&ldquo;The Kingdom of Heaven&rdquo;&mdash;are
apt to lead away the thoughts from the
present to the future, from this world to a
better one. And since men are not in Heaven
now, but are surrounded with earthly cares and
troubles, there is danger lest they should forget
or be ignorant of the intimate connection
which these words have with their daily life as
Christians, and with its duties, privileges, and
blessings.</p>

<p>And yet the practical importance of this subject
to Christian men and women will be seen
clearly after a moment&rsquo;s consideration. For any
one, who is at all acquainted with the words of
Holy Scripture, will recall to mind at once
the frequent reference to &ldquo;The Kingdom of
Heaven&rdquo; in the Gospels. And though it will
probably seem a somewhat startling assertion
to most persons, yet it is nevertheless a true
one, that from the day when our Lord began
His public ministry, until He ascended into
Heaven, His teaching was almost wholly occupied
with this one subject&mdash;&ldquo;The Kingdom
of Heaven.&rdquo; And it is the purpose of the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg&nbsp;9]</a></span>
following pages to bring together the various statements
about it, in such a way as to lead to a
clear understanding of &ldquo;The Kingdom of Heaven&rdquo;&mdash;what
it is&mdash;and of our position in this
Kingdom, with its present blessings, privileges
and duties, and its future glories.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The Kingdom of Heaven&rdquo;&mdash;What is it?</p>

<p>There are three things which are necessarily
included in the idea of a Kingdom&mdash;a King to
rule over it; subjects to be ruled; and a place
where they dwell. And since it is necessary,
if we would enquire into the nature of &ldquo;The
Kingdom of Heaven,&rdquo; first of all to understand
clearly who is the King, and who and where are
His subjects, let us begin with taking a general
view of these chief points; and then afterwards
enter more fully into the consideration of the
various passages of Holy Scripture which describe
the details of the Kingdom.</p>

<p>The Jews expected the Messiah as their King.
And when the Wise Men came from the East,
and asked &ldquo;Where is He that is born King of
the Jews&rdquo; (S. Matt. ii. 2), we read that King
Herod referred their enquiry to those who were
learned in the Scriptures, in this form, &ldquo;He
demanded of them where Christ&rdquo;&mdash;i.e. Messiah,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg&nbsp;10]</a></span>
The Anointed One<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a>&mdash;&ldquo;should be born&rdquo; (S.
Matt. ii. 4). And that there should be no doubt
at all about the person of the King, so long
expected, God in His providence had arranged
that one should go before Him to announce
His coming. For John the Baptist acted as a
herald going before a king, proclaiming his approach.
And this was the proclamation, &ldquo;Repent
ye; for the Kingdom of Heaven is at
hand&rdquo; (S. Matt. iii. 2). And then the Herald
declared that he was come as foretold by the
prophet Isaiah, and that the people must prepare
at once to receive their King, saying,
&ldquo;I am the voice of one crying in the wilderness,
Make straight the way of the Lord, as
said the prophet Esaias&rdquo; (S. John i. 23; Isaiah
xl. 3).</p>

<p>The proclamation of &ldquo;The Kingdom of Heaven&rdquo;
by John the Baptist defined the exact
time in the world&rsquo;s history when this Kingdom
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg&nbsp;11]</a></span>
took its rise. And our Lord afterwards
called express attention to this, saying, &ldquo;The
Law and the Prophets were until John: since
that time the Kingdom of God is preached, and
every man presseth into it<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a>&rdquo; (S. Luke xvi. 16).
And because John was only the Herald going
before, and was not himself enrolled as a subject
of the Kingdom, He added, (after referring to
the greatness of John the Baptist), &ldquo;Notwithstanding,
he that is least in the Kingdom of
Heaven is greater than he&rdquo; (S. Matt. xi. 11).</p>

<p>Thus we are assured that &ldquo;The Kingdom of
Heaven&rdquo; began from the proclamation of John
the Baptist; and, therefore, we know for certain
that the Lord Jesus Christ, whose coming he
proclaimed, is the King of this Kingdom.</p>

<p>This is the great truth which forms the foundation
of all the teaching of the New Testament;
and it is of the utmost importance to
have a clear idea of it. The Lord Jesus Christ
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg&nbsp;12]</a></span>
came to be the Saviour of the world by becoming
King of a spiritual Kingdom of grace
and blessing, whose subjects were to be purchased
and redeemed by His own Blood shed
upon the Cross. He was not merely the greatest
of God-inspired teachers: but He came to found
God&rsquo;s Kingdom upon earth, and to rule in love
over the hearts of men of all nations and ages,
and thus prepare them for life everlasting.
And when Nicodemus, one of the rulers of the
Jews, thus addressed Him, &ldquo;We know that thou
art a teacher come from God,&rdquo; He at once endeavoured
to lead him to grasp this truth, by
the abrupt reply, &ldquo;Verily, verily, I say unto
thee, Except a man be born again, he cannot see
the Kingdom of God;&rdquo; and again, &ldquo;Except a
man be born of water and of the Spirit, he cannot
enter into the Kingdom of God&rdquo; (S. John
iii. 2-5). In other words, men must not merely
listen to His teaching; but they must have
their eyes opened to see Him as the promised
King, and receive the principle of a new Life
as His subjects; or, else, His coming would be
in vain.</p>

<p>Taking now as our starting-point the great
truth that the Lord Jesus Christ came to found
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg&nbsp;13]</a></span>
a Kingdom, our next enquiry must be respecting
the subjects or citizens of this Kingdom.</p>

<p>Who are the subjects of &ldquo;The Kingdom of
Heaven?&rdquo;</p>

<p>One of the woes pronounced by our Lord
against the Scribes and Pharisees was for this,
&ldquo;Ye shut up the Kingdom of Heaven against
men; ye neither go in yourselves, neither suffer
ye them that are entering to go in&rdquo; (S. Matt.
xxiii. 13). They would not themselves enter
this Kingdom by accepting Him as Christ the
King; and they hindered others from doing
so. The Jews had thought themselves to be
the subjects of God, whilst all the rest of the
world were castaways. But from these words,
as well as from those referred to above, which
were spoken to Nicodemus, we conclude that
the subjects of Messiah&rsquo;s Kingdom are they, and
only they, who &ldquo;believe and confess that Jesus
is the Christ, the Son of God&rdquo; (1 S. John iv. 15,
v. 1), and, having thus accepted Him as their
King, have been admitted by a formal act into
His Kingdom.</p>

<p>When the Herald proclaimed &ldquo;The Kingdom
of Heaven is at Hand&rdquo; (S. Matt. iii. 2), he was
calling upon the whole Jewish people to enter
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg&nbsp;14]</a></span>
into it. But the call to enter Messiah&rsquo;s Kingdom
was not to be confined to the Jews. It
was to be published far and wide throughout
the world.</p>

<p>The Prophets had foretold a day when &ldquo;The
Gentiles shall come to Thy light, and kings
to the brightness of Thy rising&rdquo; (Isaiah lx. 3),
and that &ldquo;in the place where it was said unto
them, Ye are not My people, there it shall be
said unto them, Ye are the sons of the living
God&rdquo; (Hosea i. 10). And this was now about
to be fulfilled. And in the homage which the
Wise Men from the East paid to the infant
Saviour, &ldquo;born King of the Jews,&rdquo; we see the
first sign that free and full salvation was henceforth
placed within the reach of all the nations
of the world without distinction. And thus it
came to pass that, in after years, the Apostles
addressed their converts, taken equally from
amongst Jews and Gentiles, in such words as
these, &ldquo;God hath called you unto His Kingdom
and glory&rdquo; (1 Thess. ii. 12); God &ldquo;hath translated
us into the Kingdom of His dear Son&rdquo;
(Col. i. 13).</p>

<p>In other words, &ldquo;The Kingdom of Heaven&rdquo;
is a real Kingdom, though a spiritual and
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg&nbsp;15]</a></span>
heavenly one. The Lord Jesus Christ is King,
and all the nations of the world are called to
be His subjects.</p>

<p>And where is &ldquo;The Kingdom of Heaven&rdquo;?</p>

<p>The answer is clear. Wherever they are who
have accepted the King and been admitted as
His subjects.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The Kingdom <em>of</em> Heaven&rdquo; is not as yet <em>in</em>
Heaven, so far as its subjects are concerned. It
is true that the King Himself has ascended His
throne in Heaven. And as members of Christ
we share in some degree in the exaltation of our
Head, so that S. Paul does not hesitate to say
of the Lord&rsquo;s people here on earth, God &ldquo;hath
raised us up together and made us sit together
in heavenly places in Christ Jesus&rdquo; (Ephes. ii.
6). But such words seem to apply to that part
of our nature to which our hopes and affections
belong. So far as our duties and difficulties are
concerned, we are still surrounded with earthly
temptations. We are still in a state of trial
here, however much we may be looking for
and longing after our home. And Heaven will
not be opened to receive the subjects of &ldquo;The
Kingdom of Heaven&rdquo; until the Great Day,
when they will be welcomed with the words,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg&nbsp;16]</a></span>
&ldquo;Come, ye blessed of my Father, inherit the
Kingdom prepared for you&rdquo; (S. Matt. xxv. 34).</p>

<p>Christ&rsquo;s Kingdom &ldquo;is not of this world&rdquo; (S.
John xviii. 36), as He declared plainly to Pilate
when he questioned Him about Himself. But
for the present we may consider that, practically
speaking, it is <em>in</em> the world though not <em>of</em> it.
For its subjects are not yet in Heaven: but are
partly at rest in Paradise; partly here on earth
still warring against evil.</p>

<p>We can now express in few words the chief
points respecting the nature of that &ldquo;Kingdom
of Heaven&rdquo; which John the Baptist, in his office
as Herald, proclaimed to be &ldquo;at hand.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Lord Jesus Christ came to found a Kingdom.
He is the King of &ldquo;The Kingdom of
Heaven.&rdquo;</p>

<p>All who will accept Him as their King&mdash;all
the men and women and little children in the
world, of every land and of every age&mdash;may be
admitted as the subjects of &ldquo;The Kingdom of
Heaven.&rdquo; For &ldquo;He died for all&rdquo; (2 Cor. v. 15).</p>

<p>And &ldquo;The Kingdom of Heaven,&rdquo; though it
is a spiritual and heavenly Kingdom, is as yet
here on earth, and will not be in Heaven, until
the subjects of the King have been tried and
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg&nbsp;17]</a></span>
found faithful, and the number of the elect shall
be accomplished.</p>

<p>It follows that the statements of Holy Scripture
respecting &ldquo;The Kingdom of Heaven,&rdquo;
which are to be considered in the following
pages, refer not merely to the world to come&mdash;to
that which we commonly understand by
the word Heaven&mdash;but to that Kingdom which
has been founded here on earth; and into
which, as Christians, we have been already
called. And the subject becomes of infinite
importance to us all, when it is understood that
&ldquo;The Kingdom of Heaven&rdquo; is, at this present
time, that Kingdom of grace in which we may
obtain salvation through our Lord and Saviour
Jesus Christ. He has called us all to be subjects
of this Kingdom now, that, by obtaining
a share in His precious merits, we may be
brought into a state of present salvation; and
that, by continuing in this state through His
grace, we may be recognised as His subjects
in that great day, when the Kingdom of Grace
will have become the Kingdom of Glory Everlasting.</p>

<p>We have seen that, in the providence of God,
John the Baptist was sent to proclaim to the
world that &ldquo;The Kingdom of Heaven&rdquo; was at
hand, and to point out the King. And as soon
as the Herald had raised the expectation of
men by the proclamation of the coming Kingdom,
our Lord began His public ministry,
the great object of which was the founding of
His Kingdom for the salvation of the world.
And, as S. Matthew tells us, He &ldquo;went about
all Galilee teaching in their synagogues and
preaching the Gospel of the Kingdom&rdquo; (S.
Matt. iv. 23); or, as S. Mark relates, &ldquo;After
that John was put in prison, Jesus came into
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg&nbsp;19]</a></span>
Galilee preaching the Gospel of the Kingdom
of God, and saying, The time is fulfilled, and the
Kingdom of God is at hand; repent ye, and
believe the Gospel&rdquo; (S. Mark i. 14, 15).</p>

<p>Thus the King took up and continued the
message of His Herald, only adding to John the
Baptist&rsquo;s preaching of repentance the call to
believe the Gospel&mdash;to have faith in the good
tidings which He came to tell of the Kingdom
of Heaven and of God. And from this time to
the end of His ministry we find that the Gospel
of the Kingdom was the continual subject of
His teaching. Thus S. Luke records that He
declared once to a multitude which would detain
Him, &ldquo;I must preach the Kingdom of God
to other cities also; for therefore am I sent&rdquo;
(S. Luke iv. 43). And, a few chapters after, we
read, &ldquo;It came to pass afterward that He went
throughout every city and village, preaching
and showing the glad tidings of the Kingdom
of God&rdquo; (S. Luke viii. 1). And then, after a
while, &ldquo;He called His twelve disciples together,
and gave them power and authority over all
devils, and to cure diseases. And He sent them
to preach the Kingdom of God&rdquo; (S. Luke ix.
1, 2). And having thus spent the years of His
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg&nbsp;20]</a></span>
public ministry in publishing the good news of
the Kingdom, He declared towards the end of
it, as He was foretelling to His disciples the
signs of His future coming to judgment, &ldquo;And
this Gospel<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> of the Kingdom shall be preached
in all the world for a witness unto all nations;
and then shall the end come&rdquo; (S. Matt. xxiv.
14).</p>

<p>And what is the Gospel of the Kingdom?</p>

<p>To form the answer we must look to the
general teaching which runs through the Bible.
As soon as Adam fell from his high estate as
God&rsquo;s child, the Deliverer was promised, &ldquo;who
should bruise the serpent&rsquo;s head&rdquo; (Gen. iii. 15).
Ages passed with only a dim hope of a coming
Saviour; until at length God gave to Abraham
the distinct promise that the Deliverer should
arise from his posterity; saying, &ldquo;In thy seed
shall all the families of the earth be blessed&rdquo;
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg&nbsp;21]</a></span>
(Gen. xxii. 18). Again ages passed; and David
was raised up from amongst the descendants
of Abraham, and of the predicted tribe of
Judah, and to him the promise was made,
&ldquo;Thine house and thy kingdom shall be established
for ever before thee; thy throne shall
be established for ever&rdquo; (2 Sam. vii. 16). We
know that princes of the family of David succeeded
one another on the throne for 450 years,
until the Jews were carried into captivity; but
we learn from the Psalms that it had been
revealed to David himself that this promise
was not to be fulfilled in any such earthly
and temporal manner. And his faith and hopes
are expressed continually in glowing words, describing
a Kingdom of Messiah, which should
be universal and without end, a Kingdom of
righteousness and peace.</p>

<p>Thus in Psalm ii. the nations of the world are
represented in rebellion against God and the
Messiah. &ldquo;Why do the heathen rage, and the
people imagine a vain thing? The kings of the
earth set themselves, and the rulers take counsel
together, against the Lord, and against His
Anointed&rdquo; (Ps. ii. 1, 2), i.e. Messiah&mdash;Christ. And
then the decree of the universal sovereignty
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg&nbsp;22]</a></span>
of Messiah is proclaimed: &ldquo;I will declare the
decree: the Lord hath said unto me, Thou art
My Son; this day have I begotten Thee. Ask
of me, and I shall give Thee the heathen for
Thine inheritance, and the uttermost parts of the
earth for Thy possession&rdquo; (Ps. ii. 7, 8). Then
in Psalm xxii, after the mysterious sufferings of
Messiah have been set forth, His Kingdom is
again proclaimed as universal: &ldquo;All the ends of
the world shall remember and turn unto the
Lord; and all the kindreds of the nations shall
worship before Thee&rdquo; (Ps. xxii. 27). And, to
pass over other passages, in Psalm lxxii. Messiah&rsquo;s
everlasting reign of righteousness and
peace is described in glowing words: &ldquo;They
shall fear Thee as long as the sun and moon
endure, throughout all generations. In His days
shall the righteous flourish; and abundance of
peace so long as the moon endureth. All kings
shall fall down before Him; all nations shall
serve Him. His Name shall endure for ever;
and men shall be blessed in Him; all nations
shall call Him blessed<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a>&rdquo; (Ps. lxxii. 5, 7, 11, 17).</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg&nbsp;23]</a></span>
Many years passed; and then Isaiah proclaimed
in prophecy, &ldquo;Behold a King shall
reign in righteousness&rdquo; (Isai. xxxii. 1); and in
many a glowing passage described the peace
and glory of His Kingdom. And Jeremiah
yet more clearly announced, &ldquo;Behold the days
come, saith the Lord, that I will raise unto
David a righteous Branch, and a King shall
reign and prosper, and shall execute judgment
and justice in the earth. In His days Judah
shall be saved, and Israel shall dwell safely;
and this is His name whereby He shall be
called, The Lord our Righteousness&rdquo; (Jer. xxiii.
5, 6). And Daniel was directed to explain
the king&rsquo;s dream, as a vision of earthly empires,
which should be overpowered &ldquo;by the
Stone cut out without hands;&rdquo; for &ldquo;the God
of Heaven shall set up a Kingdom which shall
never be destroyed; and the Kingdom shall
not be left to other people, but it shall break
in pieces and consume all these kingdoms, and
it shall stand for ever&rdquo; (Dan. ii. 44, 45). And
Zechariah sang, &ldquo;Rejoice greatly, O daughter
of Zion; shout, O daughter of Jerusalem: behold,
thy King cometh unto thee&rdquo; (Zech. ix. 9).</p>

<p>Many years were yet to pass before the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg&nbsp;24]</a></span>
fulfilment of these promises should be commenced,
through the setting up of the everlasting
sovereignty of Messiah. But at last the
fulness of time was come; and the Angel
Gabriel appeared to the Virgin Mary at
Nazareth, and after addressing her as the
favoured mother of Messiah, declared of her
Son, &ldquo;He shall be great, and shall be called
the Son of the Highest; and the Lord God
shall give unto Him the throne of His father
David; and He shall reign over the house
of Jacob for ever, and of His Kingdom there
shall be no end&rdquo; (S. Luke i. 32, 33).</p>

<p>This then was the Gospel&mdash;the Gospel of the
Kingdom&mdash;the Gospel of God. The good
news was published abroad that the long-promised
King of the seed of David was
come. Messiah&rsquo;s Kingdom was to be set up; and
all men were invited to enter in and be saved.</p>

<p>The King Himself went forth to preach the
good news, and to describe His Kingdom and
the character of His subjects. But by what
means could He persuade the people that He
was their King? We often wonder that the
Jews were so slow to believe in Him; but
perhaps we do not realise their difficulties.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg&nbsp;25]</a></span>
There was one great obstacle which stopped
all but a very few from accepting Him. And
it was this. &ldquo;The Kingdom of Heaven&rdquo; which
He preached as the Kingdom of Messiah was
altogether different from anything which they
had expected, because it was a spiritual Kingdom.
No doubt the words of the Psalmist
and of the Prophets ought to have led them
to expect the Son of God as King. And, if
they had nurtured any real love of God in
their hearts, they would have been ready to
become His subjects. But it was not so. They
expected a conqueror to free them from the
yoke of their enemies. And the enemies which
He came to conquer were spiritual&mdash;the great
enemy of the whole human race&mdash;not the
earthly foes of the one race of Israel. They
expected the glory and pomp which are the
outward signs of the authority to rule; and
they could not understand the position which
He claimed to hold who had come in such
humility that He said, &ldquo;The Son of Man
hath not where to lay His head&rdquo; (S. Matt.
viii. 20). &ldquo;Tell us,&rdquo; they said, &ldquo;by what authority
doest thou these things?&rdquo; (S. Luke xx. 2). And,
therefore, we need not seek far to find the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg&nbsp;26]</a></span>
reason of the small success which followed the
preaching of the Gospel of the Kingdom. Only
a spiritual power can move men in spiritual
things, and a man must first give himself up
to the guidance of the Holy Spirit before He
can take in spiritual truths. If men resist the
teaching of God, no evidence will move them.
&ldquo;If they hear not Moses and the Prophets,
neither will they be persuaded though one
rose from the dead&rdquo; (S. Luke xvi. 31). &ldquo;The
Kingdom of Heaven&rdquo; could not be set up
until the Holy Ghost was given<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a>, because the
Jews were not prepared to accept Messiah as
the King of a spiritual Kingdom; and only
the Holy Ghost could move the hearts of men
to desire spiritual blessings, and to hope for
spiritual rewards.</p>

<p>So our Blessed Lord preached the Gospel of
the Kingdom to unwilling hearts; and was
compelled to &ldquo;upbraid the cities wherein most
of His mighty works were done, because they
repented not&rdquo; (S. Matt. xi. 20). Only the few
received Him&mdash;the few who were &ldquo;babes&rdquo; in
spirit&mdash;whilst &ldquo;the wise and prudent&rdquo; (S. Matt.
xi. 25) rejected Him.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg&nbsp;27]</a></span>
There were two kinds of evidence to which
He continually appealed in His arguments
with the Jewish rulers in proof of His claims
upon their hearts. The first was the direct
testimony of John the Baptist: &ldquo;Ye sent unto
John and he bare witness unto the truth&rdquo; (S.
John v. 33). For &ldquo;when the Jews sent priests
and Levites from Jerusalem to ask him, Who
art thou? he confessed, I am not the Christ&rdquo;
(S. John i. 19, 20). &ldquo;The next day John seeth
Jesus coming unto him, and saith, Behold the
Lamb of God&rdquo; (S. John i. 29). And he declared
that he knew Him in consequence of the visible
descent of the Holy Ghost upon Him at His
baptism; and (said he), &ldquo;I saw and bare record
that this is the Son of God&rdquo; (S. John i. 34).
The other evidence was &ldquo;greater witness than
that of John,&rdquo; namely, the miracles which He
wrought, for (said He) &ldquo;the works which the
Father hath given Me to finish bear witness
of Me that the Father hath sent Me&rdquo; (S. John
v. 36); and &ldquo;though ye believe not Me, believe
the works&rdquo; (S. John x. 38). Other kinds of
evidence were also employed; such as the direct
testimony of the Father in the voice from Heaven,
and in the immediate answers to prayer
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg&nbsp;28]</a></span>
in the working of His miracles&mdash;&ldquo;The Father
Himself which hath sent Me, hath borne witness
of Me&rdquo; (S. John v. 37)&mdash;and also, the
statements of Holy Scripture, describing His
person and His work so clearly that He could
say to the Jews, &ldquo;Search the Scriptures; for
they are they which testify of Me&rdquo; (S. John
v. 39). But we know the result. All the
evidences were in vain. The Jews in general
refused to believe in Him as their King. The
ruling classes not only rejected Him, but they
also hindered others from acknowledging Him.
So that He cried out against them, &ldquo;Ye shut
up the Kingdom of Heaven against men; for ye
neither go in yourselves, neither suffer ye them
that are entering to go in&rdquo; (S. Matt. xxiii. 13).</p>

<p>And there were but very few exceptions.
The Apostles and the small band of disciples
professed their faith in Him. &ldquo;Whom do men
say that I am?&rdquo; He asked them once; &ldquo;and
they said, Some say John the Baptist; some
Elias; and others, Jeremias or one of the Prophets.&rdquo;
None accepted Him as Messiah, their
King. &ldquo;But whom say ye that I am?&rdquo; He
went on to ask; &ldquo;and Simon Peter answered
and said, Thou art the Christ, the Son of the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg&nbsp;29]</a></span>
living God&rdquo; (S. Matt. xvi. 13-16). So also
Nathanael, the &ldquo;Israelite indeed,&rdquo; boldly proclaimed
his belief: &ldquo;Rabbi, Thou art the Son
of God; Thou art the King of Israel&rdquo; (S. John
i. 49). And there was one bright flash of
enthusiasm which carried all along exultingly
to welcome Him on His last visit to the Holy
City; when the crowds spread branches of the
palm-trees, and cried, &ldquo;Hosanna to the Son
of David: blessed is He that cometh in the
name of the Lord&rdquo; (S. Matt. xxi. 9). &ldquo;Blessed
be the King that cometh in the name of the
Lord: peace in Heaven, and glory in the
highest&rdquo; (S. Luke xix. 38).</p>

<p>But it was within a few days after His
triumphal entry into Jerusalem that the rulers
of the Jews took the Lord Jesus, and having
condemned Him in their own council for
blasphemy, for professing Himself to be Messiah&mdash;&ldquo;the
Christ&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;the Son of God&rdquo; (S. Luke
xxii. 67-71), they charged Him before the
Roman governor with treason, for saying &ldquo;that
He Himself is Christ a King&rdquo; (S. Luke xxiii.
2). And this accusation, it may well be
noticed, was not a different charge from the
former. All that they did was to put cleverly
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg&nbsp;30]</a></span>
before the earthly governor the earthly side
of the spiritual crime, for which they had
themselves condemned Him. If He was Messiah,
He was their King. They condemned
Him for professing to be Messiah; a charge
on which no civil tribunal could give judgment.
But professing to be Messiah, He professed
to be King; and this they represented
as an offence against the state, and to be
punished accordingly. And the result was, that
by the Providence of God He was not stoned
to death, as was His first martyr Stephen,
on the charge of blasphemy; but He was
handed over to the civil power to be crucified
for treason, as claiming to be King. And it
came to pass, that after their persistent rejection
of Him, the Jewish rulers were compelled
to see Him acknowledged upon the cross as
their King, in the words of the superscription
containing the charge on which He was condemned.
His cross became His throne, with
His title above it, &ldquo;Jesus of Nazareth, the
King of the Jews&rdquo; (S. John xix. 19). Fit
throne for Him who was &ldquo;obedient unto death,
even the death of the cross. Wherefore God
also hath highly exalted Him, and given Him
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg&nbsp;31]</a></span>
a name above every name, that at the name
of Jesus every knee should bow&rdquo; (Phil. ii. 6-10).
And all the efforts of the Jews to alter it were
in vain. Pilate at length was firm: &ldquo;What I
have written, I have written&rdquo; (S. John xix. 22).</p>

<p>Thus seemed to end the Kingdom which
our Lord and His disciples had been inviting
men to join. They could preach no more the
Gospel of the Kingdom, for the King was
put to a shameful death. &ldquo;The chief priests
and our rulers delivered Him to be condemned
to death, and have crucified Him. But we
trusted that it had been He which should
have redeemed Israel&rdquo; (S. Luke xxiv. 20,
21). So spake even the disciples in their
despair. They had &ldquo;trusted,&rdquo; as they supposed,
in vain.</p>

<p>Verily God&rsquo;s ways are not as man&rsquo;s ways.</p>

<p>What appeared to be the death-blow of &ldquo;The
Kingdom of Heaven&rdquo; was but a necessary step
in its formation. The King was crucified in
weakness, only to be &ldquo;declared to be the Son of
God with power by the resurrection from the
dead&rdquo; (Rom. i. 4). And the reason for His
humiliation has become clear to us, as expressed
in the familiar proverb, &ldquo;No cross, no
crown.&rdquo; The way to His exaltation upon the
throne of His Kingdom led by the cross. His
Kingdom must be &ldquo;purchased with His own
Blood&rdquo; (Acts xx. 28). He must &ldquo;suffer for
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg&nbsp;33]</a></span>
sins, that He might bring us to God&rdquo; (1 Pet.
iii. 18).</p>

<p>But the question now arises, What sort of
Kingdom was it that He offered unto men when
He preached to them the Gospel of the Kingdom?
Has He enabled us to form, from His
own recorded words, a definite idea of the
nature and character of &ldquo;The Kingdom of
Heaven&rdquo;?</p>

<p>For the answer we turn naturally to His
Parables; because the form of teaching which
He most commonly employed was that which
is known by the name of Parable. And we find
that fully half of them were Parables of the
Kingdom; that is to say, they either begin with
the words &ldquo;The Kingdom of Heaven is like
unto&rdquo; such and such things; or they contain
some distinct reference to it. And as the first
two of these Parables were interpreted to the
disciples, we are left in no doubt as to the
general meaning of them all.</p>

<p>The Parables of &ldquo;The Kingdom of Heaven&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg&nbsp;34]</a></span>
may be divided into two divisions. Those of
the first division relate in a general manner to
&ldquo;The Kingdom of Heaven&rdquo; or &ldquo;The Kingdom
of God,&rdquo; under its various aspects, which will
be set forth more fully in subsequent chapters;
some parables describing the Kingdom as it
may be seen on earth; some expressing the
inward spiritual reign of the King over the
hearts of men; and others teaching that those
who fail to use their opportunities as subjects
of it here, will lose the glory of sharing in its
perfect state hereafter. And the Parables of the
second division relate to certain special circumstances
which affect the position of its subjects.</p>

<p>The first division consists of the seven Parables
collected together in S. Matt. xiii; and
begins with the Parable of &ldquo;The Sower,&rdquo; which
was one of those which our Lord Himself explained.
&ldquo;Hear ye the Parable of the Sower.
When any one heareth the Word of the Kingdom,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg&nbsp;35]</a></span>
and understandeth it not, then cometh the
wicked one and catcheth away that which was
sown in his heart&rdquo; (S. Matt. xiii. 18, 19). The
good news about &ldquo;The Kingdom of Heaven&rdquo;
falls like seed. They who hear about it are like
the different kinds of soil on which seed is sown.
One pays no heed to what he hears, and the
birds of folly and thoughtlessness carry off, at
once, &ldquo;that which was sown in his heart.&rdquo; Others
desire to live as subjects of the Kingdom here,
and be prepared for its perfect state hereafter,
only they are like stony ground, or as soil which
is foul with weeds and thorns; they cannot
stand against the scorching heat of temptations
or petty persecutions, or else the cares and riches
of this world choke the word and make them
unfruitful. Whilst other men accept the good
news of the Kingdom of Jesus Christ, and bear
fruit, by living as useful subjects of their King
(S. Matt. xiii. 18-23).</p>

<p>The next Parable&mdash;&ldquo;The Tares&rdquo;&mdash;is a very
striking one, because it describes the state of
&ldquo;The Kingdom of Heaven&rdquo; as being completely
different from what men would have expected.
It was the Lord&rsquo;s own account beforehand of the
sad outward appearance of His Kingdom. It
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg&nbsp;36]</a></span>
described the work of God as being maliciously
injured and marred by Satan, so that good and
bad would be found together side by side, so
closely intermingled that it would be impossible
to separate them, or to distinguish between them.
And the separation would not be made until the
end of the world, however much men might
wish to make it at once (S. Matt. xiii. 24-30,
36-43).</p>

<p>We may well pause here for a moment to
think about the meaning of these words. Our
Blessed Lord was preaching the Gospel of the
Kingdom. And when He began to describe
the Kingdom which He came to found, He told
His disciples at once that it would be very far
from being a perfect state, such as some might
dream of. They must expect to see evil growing
wild in it, like weeds in a field of corn.
There would be bad subjects as well as good;
and there would be no means of separating
them. And as long as this world should last,
the outward appearance of &ldquo;The Kingdom of
Heaven&rdquo; would be like a field of wheat and
tares growing together.</p>

<p>At the same time He encouraged His disciples
with the prospect of boundless success.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg&nbsp;37]</a></span>
In the next Parable&mdash;&ldquo;The Grain of Mustard
Seed&rdquo;&mdash;He described, prophetically, the outward
spread of His Kingdom from very small beginnings,
until the nations of the world should find
shelter within it. For though nothing could be less
promising of success than the first beginnings of
&ldquo;The Kingdom of Heaven,&rdquo; yet, as a spreading
tree may rise from the smallest seed, even so
should His Kingdom extend its branches through
the world (S. Matt. xiii. 31, 32).</p>

<p>And this was not their only ground for encouragement
and hope. For this description of
the outward extension of the Kingdom, taken by
itself, gives a very imperfect idea of its character.
He taught them that &ldquo;The Kingdom of
Heaven&rdquo; would exert a spiritual power over the
hearts of men. It would be like leaven working
in the meal. It would change the hearts of its
subjects. The effect would be such as was
afterwards described by the Apostle S. Paul,
&ldquo;If any man be in Christ, he is a new creature&rdquo;
(2 Cor. v. 17). And as leaven goes on working
until the whole mass of the meal in which it is
hid is leavened, even so He would lead us to
understand that one heart truly leavened with
the Gospel of the Kingdom will affect others;
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg&nbsp;38]</a></span>
and that, silently and unnoticed, it will extend
until it works a moral change in the state of the
whole world (S. Matt. xiii. 33)<a name="FNanchor_7_7" id="FNanchor_7_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a>.</p>

<p>He then went on to describe that as the Kingdom
extended, men would begin to find out its
value; and for the saving of their souls would
gladly give up their worldly prospects. &ldquo;The
Hidden Treasure&rdquo; and &ldquo;The Pearl of Great
Price&rdquo; set forth the priceless value of &ldquo;The
Kingdom of Heaven.&rdquo; The rights and privileges
of citizenship are worth more than all the world
besides. These two Parables are alike in that
both express the great worth of that of which
the Gospel tells, viz. the salvation won by our
King and Saviour Jesus Christ, and given to
the subjects of His Kingdom; but they differ
in describing different ways in which men may
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg&nbsp;39]</a></span>
find it out. One man will find it like a hidden
treasure, as we should say by chance (S. Matt.
xiii. 44). So the woman of Samaria found the
long-expected Saviour, when she had only gone
to fill her pitcher at the well (S. John iv.
28, 29). Others will have to search diligently
with the earnest desire to find out &ldquo;what is
truth,&rdquo; and the truth will be brought home to
their souls only after long and patient seeking.
Like as it happened to S. Paul, who had long
been seeking for &ldquo;The Pearl,&rdquo; in being more
excessively zealous toward God, but who found
it not, until the Voice &ldquo;Why persecutest thou
Me&rdquo; (Acts ix. 4) brought him to Jesus Christ.
Furthermore, these two Parables both set forth
this truth: that, if men wish to gain the priceless
blessings of &ldquo;The Kingdom of Heaven,&rdquo;
they must be ready, as S. Paul was, to give up
all that they have, and &ldquo;count all things but
loss, that they may win Christ&rdquo; (Phil. iii. 8).</p>

<p>The character of &ldquo;The Kingdom of Heaven&rdquo;
having been thus expressed, we are carried on
in the last Parable of the series&mdash;&ldquo;The Draw-net&rdquo;&mdash;to
the end of this present world. &ldquo;The
Kingdom of Heaven&rdquo; is described as catching
in its net all, both good and bad, who come
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg&nbsp;40]</a></span>
within its reach. But, at the end, the net will
be drawn to shore, and the judgment and separation
will be made. The evil will be cast away.
The good will be preserved, and admitted to their
reward of joy and glory everlasting (S. Matt.
xiii. 47-49). And &ldquo;The Kingdom of Heaven&rdquo;
being perfected at length, and &ldquo;not having spot
or wrinkle or any such thing&rdquo; (Ephes. v. 27), will
be seen as the glorious Kingdom of righteousness
and peace described in the glowing words
of prophecy.</p>

<p>Such is the account given by our Blessed Lord
of &ldquo;The Kingdom of Heaven.&rdquo; In the above
Parables we see its nature and character described,
from its foundation to the end of this
present world. From His own words we learn
its history. There is, first, the sowing of the
seed; then the apparent spoiling of the design
by the intermixture of evil with the good; then
the Kingdom is seen to have a power of rapid
growth and extension, and a leavening influence
over the hearts of men; then its value is declared
to be so priceless, that men will give up all
things for its sake; and lastly, we are told of a
day when all evil will be purged out, and it will
become a glorious and perfect Kingdom. But
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg&nbsp;41]</a></span>
with the exception of this one faint glimpse of
eternity, there is not a word in all these Parables
respecting what we commonly understand by
the term &ldquo;Heaven.&rdquo; &ldquo;The Kingdom of Heaven&rdquo;
is here on earth, and belongs to this present
time. It was the will of our Lord to describe
His Kingdom as we know it, in its present imperfect
state here on earth, in which men have
temptations and duties, as well as great privileges
and blessings. Whilst of the future condition
of His Kingdom in glory, very little has
been revealed.</p>

<p>But besides this general description of &ldquo;The
Kingdom of Heaven,&rdquo; we find other Parables
which describe various circumstances relating to
the rejection of the Kingdom by the unbelieving,
or affecting the position of those who have
become its subjects.</p>

<p>For instance, the Apostle Peter was doubtful
how often a brother should be forgiven,
and our Lord spoke the Parable of &ldquo;The
Unmerciful Servant,&rdquo; teaching that the subjects
of His Kingdom, being themselves in a
state of forgiveness, would forfeit all their
blessings if they did not unreservedly forgive
their brethren. The debt of sin which the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg&nbsp;42]</a></span>
King has already forgiven His subjects, in admitting
them into a state of salvation, is as it
were &ldquo;ten thousand talents.&rdquo; The debt incurred
by any offending brother is but as &ldquo;an hundred
pence&rdquo; in comparison (S. Matt. xviii. 21-35).</p>

<p>Again, in the Parable of &ldquo;The Labourers in
the Vineyard&rdquo; He taught that the subjects of
His Kingdom must not grudge one against
another, if a rebel or one who has been neglecting
his duty all his life turns and is accepted at the
last. The King cannot do otherwise than what
is right. &ldquo;At the eleventh hour&rdquo; a labourer
may be taken on, and receive his reward. And,
on the other hand, one who might have been
first in the Kingdom of glory and reward may
fall away through an evil spirit of self-glorification,
and become last of all (S. Matt. xx. 1-16).</p>

<p>Three Parables follow which were spoken with
special reference to the Jewish rulers, the Priests,
and Scribes, and Pharisees. The first of these&mdash;the
Parable of &ldquo;The Two Sons&rdquo;&mdash;seems to
have been spoken to win them over to a knowledge
of their sin and danger, and, if it might be
possible, to induce them to accept the Gospel of
God, and to enter the Kingdom. The Son in
the Parable who at first said, &ldquo;I will not,&rdquo; &ldquo;afterward
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg&nbsp;43]</a></span>
repented and went.&rdquo; Even so, the bold
and open transgressors of the law were being
won over to repentance, and were entering in.
But the second son who said, &ldquo;I go Sir, and
went not,&rdquo; professed a ready obedience and then
did not carry it into practice, but held back and
refused to enter in. Even so the Pharisees and
others who made good profession of zeal for
God&rsquo;s service &ldquo;trusted in themselves that they
were righteous&rdquo; (S. Luke xviii. 9), and being
satisfied with the mere profession, &ldquo;rejected the
counsel of God against themselves&rdquo; (S. Luke
vii. 30). And He thus sorrowfully yet firmly
applied it to their own case, saying, &ldquo;Verily I
say unto you, that the publicans and harlots go
into the Kingdom of God before you&rdquo; (S. Matt.
xxi. 28-31).</p>

<p>They would not be won over; but, on the
contrary, their hostility was increased. The
consequence was, that the next Parable of &ldquo;The
Wicked Husbandmen&rdquo; declared the miserable
end which would certainly come upon them in
judgment. The Kingdom of God was set forth
under the figure of a vineyard&mdash;a figure which
must have been familiar to them from its frequent
use in the Old Testament (Psalm lxxx.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg&nbsp;44]</a></span>
8-16; Isaiah v. 1-8)&mdash;and the husbandmen, instead
of protecting their master&rsquo;s interests, were
represented as beating his servants and slaying
his son. What, asked the Lord Jesus, will he
do with them? And they answered, to their
own condemnation, &ldquo;He will miserably destroy
those wicked men, and will let out his vineyard
unto other husbandmen.&rdquo; And He then added
these plain words of warning, &ldquo;Therefore say I
unto you, The Kingdom of God shall be taken
from you<a name="FNanchor_8_8" id="FNanchor_8_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a>, and given to a nation bringing forth
the fruits thereof&rdquo; (S. Matt. xxi. 33-43).</p>

<p>The enmity of the rulers now reached its
highest pitch. &ldquo;They sought to lay hands on
Him, but they feared the multitude, because
they took Him for a prophet&rdquo; (S. Matt. xxi.
46). And as they had now clearly determined
to reject the idea of the Kingdom, which He
had come to found, the Parable of &ldquo;The Marriage
of the King&rsquo;s Son&rdquo; was spoken, describing
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg&nbsp;45]</a></span>
the call of others into the privileged position
which they despised. &ldquo;Jesus answered and
spake unto them again by Parables, and said,
The Kingdom of Heaven is like unto a certain
king which made a marriage for his son.&rdquo; And
when the invited guests refused to come, &ldquo;The
king was wroth, and sent forth his armies and
destroyed those murderers. Then said he to
his servants, The wedding is ready, but they
which were bidden were not worthy.&rdquo; Who
then should be admitted to the feast? Those
from the highways. The Gentiles from far and
wide should be called to take the place which
the Lord&rsquo;s own people refused to enjoy (S. Matt.
xxii. 1-10).</p>

<p>Two other Parables of &ldquo;The Kingdom of
Heaven&rdquo; remain to be considered&mdash;&ldquo;The Wise
and Foolish Virgins&rdquo; and &ldquo;The Talents&rdquo;&mdash;both
of which describe the judgment which the subjects
of the Kingdom must be prepared to meet
at the last day. The lessons to be learned from
them are plain. The foolish virgins, who were
shut out at the last because their lamps had
gone out, are a warning to all who profess the
faith of Christ and have once been earnest in
the spiritual service of God. They are
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg&nbsp;46]</a></span>
represented as being shut out, not for profanity and
wickedness; but for spiritual negligence&mdash;for not
seeking to keep up the supply of grace through
prayer and holy ordinances rightly used. Empty
lamps were useless. So our Lord warned His
future subjects that mere profession of faith
and mere outward ordinances, without the Spirit,
would be equally useless in preparing them to
meet His coming at the Great Day (S. Matt.
xxv. 1-13).</p>

<p>As the Parable of &ldquo;The Ten Virgins&rdquo; is a warning
against spiritual negligence, so the Parable of
&ldquo;The Talents&rdquo; teaches the danger of neglecting
the outward service of the King. The powers
and opportunities of usefulness which He has
given to His subjects, He will expect them to
use. All must work according to their talents,
or be condemned as &ldquo;unprofitable servants
and cast into outer darkness&rdquo; (S. Matt. xxv.
14-30).</p>

<p>This lesson of warning brings to an end the
Parables which describe the nature and conditions
of &ldquo;The Kingdom of Heaven&rdquo; in its
present imperfect state. But to these is added
a description, in words of striking clearness, of
the day when this present Kingdom of grace and
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg&nbsp;47]</a></span>
trial will be transformed into, and replaced by,
the Kingdom of glory and reward; &ldquo;When the
Son of Man shall come in His glory, and all the
holy angels with Him; and before Him shall
be gathered all nations; and He shall separate
them one from another, as a shepherd divideth
the sheep from the goats; and He shall set the
sheep on His right hand, but the goats on the
left.&rdquo; Then will He appear as King indeed,
seated on His throne of glory; and consequently
He now uses that title plainly of Himself.
&ldquo;Then shall the King say unto them on
His right hand, Come, ye blessed of My Father,
inherit the Kingdom prepared for you from
the foundation of the world&rdquo; (S. Matt. xxv.
31-34).</p>

<p>Thus the full meaning of the words &ldquo;The
Kingdom of Heaven&rdquo; is unfolded in the Gospels.
It is a Kingdom upon earth, springing from small
beginnings, but intended to include the whole
human race within its influence. It is the Kingdom
of God, and yet imperfect, through the
malice of the Evil One, who is ever striving to
spoil God&rsquo;s work. And whilst in the world it is
not of the world, but wholly spiritual and divine
in its origin. For God is ruling over the hearts
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg&nbsp;48]</a></span>
of its subjects. And His rule working and
spreading secretly, like leaven changing the
meal, is intended in His loving purpose to
convert the whole world unto obedience to
Himself.</p>

<p>Thus we see that &ldquo;The Kingdom of Heaven&rdquo;
is described as being that state of grace and
probation into which Christ&rsquo;s people are called
at the time of their baptism, and in which they
are blessed, and tried, and made fit for His
nearer Presence. But, at the same time, we are
led to think that a day will come when this
present imperfect condition of His Kingdom will
be brought to an end; when those who have
been tried and found worthless will be cast out;
and &ldquo;The Kingdom of Heaven&rdquo; as we know it,
having been purged of all evil, will become the
Kingdom of His glory and joy.</p>

<p>And when this shall come to pass, all the predictions
respecting Messiah&rsquo;s Kingdom will at
length be realised. &ldquo;The everlasting Kingdom&rdquo;
(2 Peter i. 11) ordained &ldquo;before the foundation of
the world&rdquo; (Ephes. i. 4), will then have embraced
all nations, so that &ldquo;the earth shall be full of the
knowledge of the Lord, as the waters cover the
sea&rdquo; (Isaiah xi. 9). Then will the reign of
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[Pg&nbsp;49]</a></span>
righteousness and peace of Him, who is &ldquo;the
Lord our Righteousness&rdquo; (Jer. xxiii. 6), appear
in all its perfect beauty. God&rsquo;s &ldquo;people will be
all righteous;&rdquo; and &ldquo;inherit the land for ever&rdquo;
(Isaiah lx. 21), even &ldquo;the inheritance of the
saints in light&rdquo; (Col. i. 12). And Christ, being
at length in every sense &ldquo;the Prince of Peace&rdquo;
(Isaiah ix. 6), when no foe will be left to be subdued,
and &ldquo;they shall not hurt nor destroy in all
My holy mountain&rdquo; (Isaiah xi. 9), will then be
proclaimed &ldquo;King of Kings and Lord of Lords&rdquo;
(Rev. xix. 16).</p>

<p>And then also our daily prayer &ldquo;Thy Kingdom
come&rdquo; (S. Matt. vi. 10) will have received
its perfect fulfilment. For all that is now imperfect
in His rule will have been set right; through
the conversion of the heathen, the repentance
of the ungodly, and the sanctification of all
who &ldquo;neglect&rdquo; not &ldquo;so great salvation&rdquo; (Heb.
ii. 3).</p>

<p>The number of the elect will be accomplished.
The Son will &ldquo;have delivered up the Kingdom
to God, even the Father;&rdquo; God will be &ldquo;all in
all&rdquo; (1 Cor. xv. 24, 28).</p>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_6_6" id="Footnote_6_6"></a><a href="#FNanchor_6_6"><span class="label">[6]</span></a> To prevent any doubt arising in the mind of the
reader, it may be well to state that the expressions
&ldquo;Kingdom of Heaven&rdquo; and &ldquo;Kingdom of God&rdquo; are used
indiscriminately and with the same meaning in these
Parables. By comparing S. Matt. xiii. 31 with S. Mark
iv. 30 and S. Luke xiii. 18 it will be seen that &ldquo;The
Kingdom of Heaven&rdquo; is &ldquo;The Kingdom of God,&rdquo; and
&ldquo;The Kingdom of God&rdquo; is &ldquo;The Kingdom of Heaven.&rdquo;
S. Matthew nearly always uses the expression &ldquo;Kingdom
of Heaven,&rdquo; whilst S. Mark and S. Luke use the expression
&ldquo;Kingdom of God.&rdquo;</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_7_7" id="Footnote_7_7"></a><a href="#FNanchor_7_7"><span class="label">[7]</span></a> Because leaven is commonly referred to in Holy
Scripture as a symbol of evil, some have interpreted this
Parable in a very different manner. But the meaning
assigned to it above is in accordance with ancient interpretation;
and the other explanation is involved in difficulties.
For, if the leaven represents a corrupting influence,
the Parable would describe the Kingdom of Heaven
either as having an evil effect upon the world, or else as
progressing itself towards corruption till the whole is
corrupted.</p></div>

<p>The Subjects of &ldquo;The Kingdom of Heaven&rdquo;&mdash;who
are they?</p>

<p>The subjects of a kingdom are, in a general
way, those who have been born within its limits,
and who submit to its laws and accept its king.
But when we enquire into the teaching of our
Lord about the subjects of &ldquo;The Kingdom
of Heaven,&rdquo; we are met at once with the difficulty
that, in the days of His earthly ministry,
the Kingdom was not yet founded<a name="FNanchor_9_9" id="FNanchor_9_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a>. The King
was only preparing the way for His Kingdom to
be set up. And there is necessarily a great
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg&nbsp;51]</a></span>
difference between joining a Kingdom in the act
of being founded, and being born under its laws
and within its limits.</p>

<p>Consequently with respect to His teaching
about the Subjects of &ldquo;The Kingdom of Heaven,&rdquo;
two things have to be considered. First, the conditions
under which men are permitted to join
His Kingdom; and, secondly, the life which His
subjects are required to lead.</p>

<p>At the very commencement of His ministry
a divine picture was drawn of the character and
life of the true subjects of &ldquo;The Kingdom of
Heaven.&rdquo; For as He &ldquo;went about all Galilee
preaching the Gospel of the Kingdom, there
followed Him great multitudes of people. And
seeing the multitudes, He went up into a mountain:
and when He was set, His disciples came
unto Him: and He opened His mouth, and
taught them, saying, Blessed are the poor in
spirit, for theirs is the Kingdom of Heaven&rdquo;
(S. Matt. iv. 23-v. 3). Thus He began the
Sermon on the Mount by declaring the blessedness
of His subjects, though they would be very
different from those whom the world commonly
counts blessed. And the last Beatitude ended,
as the first began, with distinct reference to the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg&nbsp;52]</a></span>
Kingdom, &ldquo;Blessed are they which are persecuted
for righteousness&rsquo; sake; for theirs is the Kingdom
of Heaven&rdquo; (S. Matt. v. 10); as though to
make it clear to His hearers that the blessedness
spoken of throughout all the verses was
connected with His Kingdom.</p>

<p>He then addressed those who, in their hearts,
accepted Him, as &ldquo;the salt of the earth;&rdquo; and
as &ldquo;the light of the world&rdquo; (S. Matt. v. 13, 14).
They would not only be blessed in themselves,
as His subjects, but they would also be a blessing
to others. They were to be the salt which
should preserve the world from corruption;
and the light which should lead men to &ldquo;glorify
their Father which is in Heaven&rdquo; (S. Matt.
v. 16).</p>

<p>Having thus described, at the beginning of
His Sermon, the general character and office of
the subjects of His Kingdom, our Blessed Lord
went on to answer a question, which would
doubtless arise in the minds of His hearers.
Would the Kingdom of which He spoke destroy,
or be opposed to the Law, under which God&rsquo;s
People had lived from ancient times? The
answer was most distinct: &ldquo;Think not that I
am come to destroy the Law and the Prophets;
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg&nbsp;53]</a></span>
I am not come to destroy, but to fulfil. Whosoever
therefore shall break one of these least
commandments, and shall teach men so, he shall
be called the least in the Kingdom of Heaven.
For I say unto you, That except your righteousness
shall exceed the righteousness of the Scribes
and Pharisees, ye shall in no case enter into the
Kingdom of Heaven&rdquo; (S. Matt. v. 17-20). So
far from coming to destroy the Law, He had
come that it might be fulfilled by His subjects,
as it had never been fulfilled before. For they
would be required to surpass even the Scribes
and Pharisees in their observance of it, by keeping
it in the spirit, as well as in the letter; otherwise
they would prove themselves unfit for His
Kingdom. And then followed examples of the
observance of some of the laws of old&mdash;such as
the law of purity, and the law against murder&mdash;in
this enlarged spiritual sense; ending with the exhortation,
&ldquo;Be ye therefore perfect, even as your
Father which is in Heaven is perfect&rdquo; (S. Matt.
v. 21-48).</p>

<p>One of the chief ways in which God&rsquo;s People
had failed in their service towards Him, was in
the spirit in which they had discharged their
religious duties. Righteousness had become but
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg&nbsp;54]</a></span>
another name for formality. Prayers and alms
and fasts had been turned into opportunities for
showing off before men, and for gaining the
reputation of sanctity. Consequently it was
necessary that He should lead back His hearers
to the real meaning of these duties; and set
forth the principle which must guide His subjects
in all their religious acts&mdash;almsgiving, prayer,
and fasting&mdash;namely, this; the desire to please
their &ldquo;Father which is in Heaven&rdquo; (S. Matt. vi.
1-18). And that there might be no mistake
about the kind of rewards which they might
look for, He declared that they must &ldquo;lay up for
themselves treasures in Heaven&rdquo; (S. Matt. vi.
19-21); that is to say, they must love and long
for spiritual rewards, setting their hearts upon
higher things than this world can give. And the
only way in which they could do this, was by
devoting themselves with their whole strength to
the service of God. For no half-service of God
was possible: &ldquo;Ye cannot serve God and Mammon&rdquo;
(S. Matt. vi. 24). Then if they lived for
God, they might lay aside all over-anxious
thoughts about this present life. If they really
gave themselves up to be His subjects, they
would certainly have all things ordered for them
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[Pg&nbsp;55]</a></span>
for the best. &ldquo;Seek ye first the Kingdom of God
and His righteousness, and all these things shall
be added unto you&rdquo; (S. Matt. vi. 33).</p>

<p>The Sermon ended with mentioning some of
the difficulties which the subjects of &ldquo;The Kingdom
of Heaven&rdquo; would have to meet in the
practice of godliness. In the first place, in order
to become His subjects they would have to
enter through a narrow gate, upon a path which
few would find. For whilst, on the one hand,
&ldquo;Wide is the gate and broad is the way that
leadeth to destruction, and many there be that
go in thereat,&rdquo; on the other hand, &ldquo;Strait is the
gate and narrow is the way which leadeth unto
life, and few there be that find it&rdquo; (S. Matt. vii.
13, 14). And when they had entered upon this
narrow way, He warned them that they must be
on their guard against being misled by foolish
professors, because mere profession of obedience
would neither prove them to be subjects of His
Kingdom, nor win for them admission &ldquo;in that
day&rdquo; into His glory and joy, &ldquo;Not every one
that saith unto Me, Lord, Lord, shall enter into
the Kingdom of Heaven, but he that doeth the
will of My Father which is in Heaven&rdquo; (S. Matt.
vii. 21-23). Therefore they must set to work to
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg&nbsp;56]</a></span>
do the will of God, and so be true subjects of
Messiah&rsquo;s Kingdom. And then, as doers of His
words, and not hearers only, they would be
building like wise men &ldquo;upon a rock&rdquo; (S. Matt.
vii. 24).</p>

<p>The description thus given by the King Himself
of the character and life of His subjects sets
vividly before us the difficulties which a Christian
must overcome. It may not be always easy to
decide whether the expression &ldquo;Kingdom of
Heaven&rdquo; refers to the Kingdom as it is now on
earth, or as it will be hereafter in Heaven; but
it is clear that our Blessed Lord would teach
in this Sermon both the difficulty of becoming
a professing Christian at all, and also the need
of earnest strivings after holiness in order that
a subject of His Kingdom of Grace should find
a welcome when that Kingdom shall have become
the Kingdom of Glory. And when we
think of the very different standards hitherto
aimed at either by Jews or Gentiles, we see at
once the reason which prevented so many of
His hearers from accepting &ldquo;The Kingdom of
Heaven.&rdquo; For it is clear that a man who had
been brought up either as a Jew or as a Gentile
would have to lay aside almost all his previous
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg&nbsp;57]</a></span>
habits and modes of thought&mdash;he must become
a new man altogether&mdash;to enter in.</p>

<p>Who then would enter in? Who would become
subjects of the Kingdom of Heaven?</p>

<p>The Lord Jesus declared at once, what modern
missionary experience still finds to be the case,
that little children were the most likely to become
His subjects, and the fittest to enter into
&ldquo;The Kingdom of Heaven.&rdquo; Some mothers
once brought their little ones for His blessing;
and when the disciples were hindering their
coming, &ldquo;He was much displeased and said unto
them, Suffer little children to come unto Me,
and forbid them not; for of such is the Kingdom
of God&rdquo; (S. Mark x. 14). And not only did He
declare that little children were the most suitable
to become His subjects; but He said also,
that those who were grown up and wished to
enter His Kingdom must become like children
to do so. For He added, &ldquo;Verily I say unto
you, Whosoever shall not receive the Kingdom of
God as a little child, he shall not enter therein&rdquo;
(S. Mark x. 15). And on another occasion He
expressed His thankfulness that only child-like
hearts could take in the mysteries of the Kingdom,
saying, &ldquo;I thank Thee, O Father, Lord of
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg&nbsp;58]</a></span>
heaven and earth, that Thou hast hid these
things from the wise and prudent, and hast
revealed them unto babes&rdquo; (S. Luke x. 21).</p>

<p>When we read in such passages as these of
the difficulty of entering into &ldquo;The Kingdom of
Heaven,&rdquo; it becomes very important to remember
that the Kingdom was not then set up; and that
the words were spoken with respect to men who
had grown up under other conditions and modes
of thought. For whilst the words still apply
literally and exactly to the case of converts from
amongst the Heathen, they are not applicable at
all, in the same sense, to persons who have long
ago entered &ldquo;The Kingdom of Heaven&rdquo; as
children, and have lived under its influence.
Thus, for instance, when we read that &ldquo;a rich
man shall hardly enter into the Kingdom of
Heaven&rdquo; (S. Matt. xix. 23), there is no need to
suppose that the rich, who have grown up as His
subjects, have less hope of Heaven than others.
The temptations which come with riches are
great, but the grace of God will enable His
subjects, whether rich or poor, to serve Him
faithfully, if they seek for it. The words clearly
referred to the difficulty which the rich Jew or
the rich heathen would find in declaring himself
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[Pg&nbsp;59]</a></span>
a subject of Jesus Christ. It is easier for the
poor and the unlearned to become a Christian,
than for the rich and the learned. In after
years S. Paul found this to be the case at Corinth.
&ldquo;Ye see your calling, brethren, how that
not many wise men after the flesh, not many
mighty, not many noble are called&rdquo; (1 Cor. i. 26).
And the same thing is still happening in heathen
lands. The chief successes in India have been
amongst the low castes of Tinnevelly, the hard-working
Kols of Chota Nagpur, the simple
Karens of the hills of Burma; and amongst the
wealthy merchants and the learned Brahmins
converts have been few. Experience confirms
the truth of our Lord&rsquo;s teaching. He declared
beforehand, that the rich, and the learned, and
those who had enjoyed the greatest privileges,
would be the most unwilling to be won over to
His Kingdom. And the prediction has been
fulfilled.</p>

<p>It might have been supposed that, when at
last Messiah&rsquo;s Kingdom was set up, all who had
enjoyed the privilege of knowing the true God,
and had been taught to expect a Deliverer, as
their King, would have eagerly sought admission
into His Kingdom. But to one who made the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg&nbsp;60]</a></span>
remark, &ldquo;Blessed is he that shall eat bread in
the Kingdom of God,&rdquo; He spoke the Parable of
&ldquo;The Great Supper,&rdquo; teaching that many, who
have the opportunity and the invitation will
refuse to enter in, and make all kinds of excuses;
and that others will have their places (S. Luke
xiv. 15-24). And on another occasion He
warned the Jews, that many would come from
all quarters of the world, &ldquo;and sit down in the
Kingdom of God&rdquo; (S. Luke xiii. 28, 29), whilst
they themselves were thrust out. And we know
how literally the warning has come true. And
lest any one should be deceived into thinking
that it was an easy thing to become His subject,
He referred again and again to the difficulties
which men must be prepared to meet and overcome
in entering &ldquo;The Kingdom of Heaven.&rdquo;
To those who said that they would follow Him,
He explained that entire devotion of self to God
would be required of His subjects. A man must
count the cost beforehand. &ldquo;The dead&rdquo; must
be left to &ldquo;bury their dead,&rdquo; whilst the man
fulfils the commission which God entrusts to him,
to &ldquo;preach the Kingdom of God;&rdquo; and &ldquo;No
man having put his hand to the plough, and
looking back, is fit for the Kingdom of God&rdquo;
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[Pg&nbsp;61]</a></span>
(S. Luke ix. 57-62). But, on the other hand, for
those who gave up freely all that they loved,
&ldquo;for the Kingdom of God&rsquo;s sake,&rdquo; the reward
should be &ldquo;manifold more&rdquo; even &ldquo;in this present
time, and in the world to come life everlasting.&rdquo;
(S. Luke xviii. 29, 30). And He encouraged the
few, who in their hearts accepted Him as their
King, in such words as these, &ldquo;Him that cometh
unto me I will in no wise cast out&rdquo; (S. John
vi. 37); &ldquo;Fear not, little flock; for it is your
Father&rsquo;s good pleasure to give you the Kingdom&rdquo;
(S. Luke xii. 32).</p>

<p>The thought that the difficulties thus described
referred in the first instance to those who were
outside of &ldquo;The Kingdom of Heaven,&rdquo; may well
fill us with thankfulness that we have been
brought into the Kingdom through the piety of
our parents, without even an effort on our parts.
We have been so far helped already, that we
have been placed upon the narrow way that
leadeth unto life; and though temptations of
many kinds assail to entice us from the road,
and though the difficulties of the way are great,
we have the hope to encourage us, that, if we are
in earnest, the grace of God the Holy Ghost will
preserve us, that we may be welcomed at last as
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Pg&nbsp;62]</a></span>
faithful subjects, and admitted into the Kingdom
of Glory.</p>

<p>But at the same time we must remember that,
in another sense, the words about the difficulty
of entering &ldquo;The Kingdom of Heaven&rdquo; still
apply to ourselves. For we have been admitted
as subjects of the Kingdom, only that we may
loyally serve our King; and we have been placed
upon the narrow way, only that we may struggle
up the steep ascent to Heaven. &ldquo;The Kingdom
of Heaven&rdquo; is as yet in an imperfect condition
here on earth. Here we are in a state of trial
and probation, as well as of grace and blessing.
And a day will come when the Kingdom of
Grace will become the Kingdom of Glory. Then,
they who have served their King, and proved
themselves in the time of their trial to be His
faithful soldiers and servants, will be welcomed
into the joy of their Lord. But they who have
professed to be His subjects, and have been
satisfied with a mere profession, will cry, &ldquo;Lord,
Lord&rdquo; (S. Matt. vii. 22-23), in vain.</p>

<p>Therefore, our King still cries to us, as to His
hearers before the Kingdom was set up, &ldquo;Strive
to enter in&rdquo; (S. Luke xiii. 24). He still bids us
build &ldquo;upon the Rock,&rdquo; by being &ldquo;doers of the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[Pg&nbsp;63]</a></span>
word, and not hearers only&rdquo; (S. James i. 22).
And He still warns us of the dangers of riches;
&ldquo;The love of money is the root of all evil&rdquo; (1 Tim.
vi. 10). For we have still to be &ldquo;the salt of the
earth&rdquo; and &ldquo;the light of the world&rdquo; (S. Matt. v.
13, 14). And the standard which He has set us
is still, and ever will be, far above us; &ldquo;Be ye
therefore perfect, even as your Father which is in
Heaven is perfect&rdquo; (S. Matt. v. 48).</p>

<p>The teaching of our Lord about His subjects
is thus seen to correspond with what His Apostles,
in time to come, taught their converts when
they addressed them, as &ldquo;called to be saints&rdquo;
(Rom. i. 7, Ephes. i. 1, etc.). We know that the
world would like to find some easier course than
this. But it is impossible; because the subjects
of &ldquo;The Kingdom <em>of</em> Heaven&rdquo; are called that
they may be ready for the life <em>in</em> Heaven. And
&ldquo;without holiness no man shall see the Lord&rdquo;
(Heb. xii. 14).</p>

<p>In subsequent chapters we shall consider the
means provided by the King to enable His subjects
to become such as He described them.
For the present, let the thought of our holy
calling increase our sense of the infinite love
and mercy of our King.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg&nbsp;64]</a></span>
Let us think of His own description of His
work. &ldquo;The Son of Man is come to seek and
to save that which was lost&rdquo; (S. Luke xix. 10).
When we were wandering in the ways of sin,
ignorant of God our Father, and unfit to be
admitted into our home or to enjoy it if admission
were possible, He came to seek us out
and bring us into His Kingdom. And now
that He has &ldquo;overcome the sharpness of death
and opened the Kingdom of Heaven to all
believers,&rdquo; our efforts after holiness are so imperfect,
and our weakness and love of wandering
are so great, that we should be in despair, if our
King had not taught us His unceasing care.
But this He has set forth in a well-known series
of Parables; first, under the figure of a shepherd
finding a stray sheep and calling friends
and neighbours to rejoice over its recovery;
then under the figure of a woman finding the
lost coin; and, lastly, under the figure of a
father welcoming home his prodigal son (S.
Luke xv).</p>

<p>Therefore, our position is this. As subjects
of &ldquo;The Kingdom of Heaven,&rdquo; we are called,
according to our Lord&rsquo;s own teaching, to a
high and holy life; and the more we realise
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[Pg&nbsp;65]</a></span>
this truth the greater do our imperfections appear,
and the clearer becomes our sense of the
need of mercy, as well as help. But the King,
who thus described His subjects, has also described
His enduring love; and His invitation,
still and for ever, applies to all who feel their
unworthiness: &ldquo;Come unto Me all ye that
labour and are heavy laden, and I will give you
rest&rdquo; (S. Matt. xi. 28).</p>

<p>Hitherto our thoughts about &ldquo;The Kingdom
of Heaven&rdquo; have been founded on the
teaching of the King respecting His Kingdom
recorded in the Gospels. But we must not
forget to give attention to the very important
time in the life of our Lord extending between
His Resurrection and Ascension, during which
He appeared to His Apostles upon terms very
different from those on which He had previously
associated with them<a name="FNanchor_10_10" id="FNanchor_10_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a>. And though few records
have been preserved of His instructions to them
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[Pg&nbsp;67]</a></span>
during this period, we find this general description,
which very clearly shows the nature of those
instructions. In the Book of the Acts of the
Apostles, S. Luke records that the time was
spent in &ldquo;speaking of the things pertaining to
the Kingdom of God&rdquo; (Acts i. 3). Consequently,
though we have not His discourses in
full, we know that the subject of them was still
the same as in the time past&mdash;the good news of
&ldquo;The Kingdom of Heaven.&rdquo;</p>

<p>During the years of His public ministry the
Apostles frequently asked their Lord to explain
what they did not understand in His teaching.
And we may feel sure that, at this time, many
things must have appeared to them in a new
light, and many sayings must have gained a
force and meaning which they had failed to
perceive before. And if &ldquo;The Kingdom of
Heaven,&rdquo; about which He had said so much,
was to be a real Kingdom, it is clear that there
must have been many things on which they
would require instruction, about the order and
government of it, and about the practical carrying
out of His loving designs for the salvation of
the world. And inasmuch as we find that,
almost immediately after their Lord&rsquo;s Ascension,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[Pg&nbsp;68]</a></span>
the Apostles were fully prepared not merely to
preach, as He had done, the good news of the
Kingdom, but to call men into it as a Kingdom
already established upon earth, we conclude that
all these matters must have been fully explained
to them during these days, and that these were
&ldquo;the things pertaining to the Kingdom of God&rdquo;
of which He spake.</p>

<p>Passing by, for the present, other questions of
difficulty which would very probably arise in
their minds, there are two passages in our Lord&rsquo;s
discourses recorded in the Gospels which we can
hardly doubt were discussed at this time; because
some of His words have been preserved to us
which connect those passages with what afterwards
became the practice of the Church.</p>

<p>The first question of difficulty which would
naturally arise out of one of His former sayings,
and to which He provided the answer, was this&mdash;What
was to be the form of admission into
&ldquo;The Kingdom of Heaven&rdquo;? He had said to
Nicodemus, &ldquo;Verily, verily, I say unto thee,
Except a man be born of water and of the
Spirit, he cannot enter the Kingdom of God&rdquo;
(S. John iii. 5). But what did the words mean?
What steps were to be taken by one who wished
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[Pg&nbsp;69]</a></span>
to enter the Kingdom? With what use of water
would the Holy Spirit&rsquo;s power be connected?
Here was a practical question requiring a decided
answer. And we conclude that this was one of
&ldquo;the things pertaining to the Kingdom&rdquo; which
were spoken of during this time, because we find
a brief record of distinct instructions given by
our Lord to His Apostles how they were to
admit men as His disciples or subjects. No
discourse is recorded, but this clear commission
is handed down by S. Matthew&mdash;evidently given
in such a way that the Apostles could not fail to
understand its meaning&mdash;&ldquo;Go ye and make
disciples<a name="FNanchor_11_11" id="FNanchor_11_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a> of all nations, baptizing them in the
Name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the
Holy Ghost&rdquo; (S. Matt. xxviii. 19). And consequently
Holy Baptism became at once, and has
been ever since, the form of admission into
&ldquo;The Kingdom of Heaven&rdquo; (Acts ii. 38-41).
And being an outward form, and yet a spiritual
act, we have herein both &ldquo;the water and the
Spirit.&rdquo; It is an outward form in which there is
a ceremonial use of water; and yet it is a
spiritual act, because united with the most
solemn naming of the Name of God, as He
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[Pg&nbsp;70]</a></span>
has in these last days revealed Himself to man;
&ldquo;In the Name of the Father, and of the Son, and
of the Holy Ghost;&rdquo; and S. Paul does not
hesitate to say, &ldquo;By one Spirit are we all baptized
into one Body&rdquo; (1 Cor. xii. 13).</p>

<p>The other question arising out of some words
of our Lord, which we conclude was discussed
and answered by Him during this time, was
the difficult one about the meaning of &ldquo;the
keys of the Kingdom of Heaven.&rdquo; He had
once said, after S. Peter had confessed Him as
the Christ, &ldquo;I will give unto thee the keys of the
Kingdom of Heaven; and whatsoever thou
shalt bind on earth shall be bound in heaven;
and whatsoever thou shalt loose on earth shall
be loosed in heaven<a name="FNanchor_12_12" id="FNanchor_12_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a>&rdquo; (S. Matt. xvi. 19). And
the same words about binding and loosing were
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[Pg&nbsp;71]</a></span>
repeated shortly afterwards to all the Apostles
(S. Matt. xviii. 18). We can hardly doubt but
that the question must have arisen in their minds
what the keys of the Kingdom could be whereby
the power of binding and loosing was given them.
And although no discourse is recorded, it seems
that this was another of &ldquo;the things pertaining
to the Kingdom&rdquo; of which He spoke. For S.
John, in the brief record which he has given of
His first appearance to the Apostles after His
Resurrection, has thus described what occurred:&mdash;Suddenly
the Lord was in their midst, and
said, &ldquo;Peace be unto you. And He showed
unto them His Hands and His Side&rdquo; in proof
that it was He Himself. And He said again
&ldquo;Peace be unto you. As My Father hath sent
Me, even so send I you.&rdquo; And &ldquo;He breathed
on them, and said, Receive ye the Holy Ghost:
whose soever sins ye remit, they are remitted
unto them; and whose soever sins ye retain,
they are retained&rdquo; (S. John xx. 19-23). And
ever since there has been this practical interpretation
of the meaning of &ldquo;the keys.&rdquo; Christ&rsquo;s
ministers have confidently acted, as having been
entrusted by their Lord with His authority to
admit men into &ldquo;The Kingdom of Heaven&rdquo; by
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[Pg&nbsp;72]</a></span>
Holy Baptism, or to defer the act of admission
until after longer probation; to exercise the
judicial power of excommunication, or expulsion
from the Kingdom, for notorious sin and unbelief,
as in the case of the incestuous Corinthian
(1 Cor. v. 3-7), or to re-admit after repentance,
as S. Paul decided to do in the same case
(2 Cor. ii. 6-10); and to assure all men that in
the holy Ordinances of the Church of Christ free
and full remission of sins may be certainly gained.</p>

<p>We can readily imagine that many other
matters were discussed amongst &ldquo;the things
pertaining to the Kingdom of God.&rdquo;</p>

<p>If disciples were to be made in all parts of the
world, and were then to be taught &ldquo;to observe
all things commanded&rdquo; (S. Matt. xxviii. 20) by
the King, the question must have arisen, Who
were to be appointed to teach them? And thus
the whole subject of the government of &ldquo;The
Kingdom of Heaven,&rdquo; and the Orders and duties
of the King&rsquo;s Ministers, would be opened.</p>

<p>Again, the words of institution of the Sacrament
of the Lord&rsquo;s Supper, &ldquo;This is My Blood
of the new testament<a name="FNanchor_13_13" id="FNanchor_13_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a>, which is shed for many
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[Pg&nbsp;73]</a></span>
for the remission of sins&rdquo; (S. Matt. xxvi. 28),
pointed both to the ending of the old covenant,
or testament, which was sealed in the blood
of beasts (Exod. xxiv. 5-8), and to the passing
away of the Jewish ritual and modes of worship.
And the question would arise, What
forms of worship were to be observed by His
subjects in place of those ordained by the Law
of Moses? Sacrifices could no longer have
their former meaning, when the Lamb of God,
to which they pointed the worshipper, had
been offered upon the Cross. Was &ldquo;the breaking
of bread&rdquo; to take the place of all the old
sacrificial services?</p>

<p>And with the subject of worship, the observance
of the Sabbath would need to be considered.
Was the Jewish Sabbath still binding
on men&rsquo;s consciences? Was the Seventh Day
to be observed in accordance with the Law of
Moses, or was the First Day of the week to take
its place, now sacred to the subjects of the Lord
Jesus as that on which He rose, and to the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[Pg&nbsp;74]</a></span>
keeping of which He had seemed to give His
sanction, by appearing once and again on that
day to the disciples as they were assembled
together? (S. John xx. 19, 26.)</p>

<p>On all these points<a name="FNanchor_14_14" id="FNanchor_14_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a> we find, in the Book of
the Acts of the Apostles, that the Apostles took
at once a definite line of action. They knew
what to do, and how to direct their converts.
And though we have no record of the words
of our Lord, we are confident that the Apostles
were thus carrying out His own teaching<a name="FNanchor_15_15" id="FNanchor_15_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a>,
under the guidance of the Holy Ghost,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[Pg&nbsp;75]</a></span>
on all such matters &ldquo;pertaining to the Kingdom
of God.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Amongst the few words recorded as having
been spoken at this time to the Apostles, is this
clear promise, &ldquo;Ye shall receive power, after
that the Holy Ghost is come upon you; and ye
shall be witnesses unto Me both in Jerusalem,
and in all Jud&aelig;a, and in Samaria, and unto the
uttermost part of the earth&rdquo; (Acts i. 8). And
in the power of the Holy Ghost we find that
they went forth to publish the glad tidings of
&ldquo;The Kingdom of Heaven.&rdquo; And, beginning
from Jerusalem, they extended their work
gradually to Samaria, and Syria, and to all
countries, carrying out their Lord&rsquo;s commission,
and preaching the good news of salvation
through Jesus Christ, as freely offered to all
who would accept Him as their King, and enter
through the strait gate of the New Birth into
His Kingdom.</p>

founded their argument, in support of the claims of the
Papacy, very mainly upon this verse; starting with the
assumption, of which there is no proof, that the Pope
is the successor of S. Peter, and asserting that a power
was hereby given to S. Peter which the other Apostles
did not possess. The weakness of the argument becomes
clear when it is known that the same words were repeated
again to all the Apostles; and that the above
explanation, and practical enforcement of them, were
equally spoken to them all.</p></div>

the same word. The Bible is divided into the Old and

Covenant made with all the world through Jesus Christ.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_14_14" id="Footnote_14_14"></a><a href="#FNanchor_14_14"><span class="label">[14]</span></a> A question may arise in the minds of some, whether
it is a historical fact that the early Christians were in no
doubt about the substitution of the First for the Seventh
day? The answer is that, from the first, there was no
doubt about the observance of the First Day; but that
amongst the Jewish converts the observance of the Sabbath
was permitted for some time, in addition to the
Christian festival, and was only gradually discontinued.
See Rom. xiv. 5; Gal. iv. 10; Col. ii. 16; and compare
Acts xx. 7; 1 Cor. xvi. 2; Rev. i. 10.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_15_15" id="Footnote_15_15"></a><a href="#FNanchor_15_15"><span class="label">[15]</span></a> This view is strengthened by the account given by
S. Paul of the direct revelation granted to him respecting
the Sacrament of the Lord&rsquo;s Supper. Not having been
amongst the number of His Apostles in the days when
He was on earth, S. Paul had received no instructions
from His own mouth. But the defect was supplied by
direct revelation. He says, &ldquo;I have received of the Lord
that which also I delivered unto you, that the Lord Jesus,
the same night in which He was betrayed, took bread,&rdquo; &amp;c.
(1 Cor. xi. 23).</p></div>

<p>When the time came for our Blessed Lord to
return into Heaven again, He ascended in the
presence of His Apostles, whilst in the act of
blessing them; &ldquo;and a cloud received Him out of
their sight&rdquo; (Acts i. 9). And, we are told, they
&ldquo;returned to Jerusalem with great joy&rdquo; (S. Luke
xxiv. 52), not sorrowing as before at His being
taken from them. And when we consider what
His Ascension implied, we can see that they had
good reason for their joy. For the Ascension
was the sign of the exaltation of the Lord Jesus
to His Mediatorial<a name="FNanchor_16_16" id="FNanchor_16_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_16_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a> Throne at God&rsquo;s right hand.</p>

<p>When He was before the Jewish Council He
had declared to them, &ldquo;Hereafter shall ye see
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[Pg&nbsp;77]</a></span>
the Son of man sitting on the right hand of
power.&rdquo; And the High Priest, hearing these
words, cried out, &ldquo;He hath spoken blasphemy&rdquo;
(S. Matt. xxvi. 64, 65); because he understood
that He was thus openly claiming to be Messiah&mdash;the
King&mdash;of whom David had said, &ldquo;The
Lord said unto my Lord, Sit Thou at My right
hand until I make Thine enemies Thy footstool&rdquo;
(Ps. cx. 1). And inasmuch as He had previously
silenced the Pharisees with these same words,
asking them to explain how David could speak
of Messiah as &ldquo;my Lord&rdquo; (S. Matt. xxii. 44;
S. Mark xii. 36; S. Luke xx. 42), when He was
to be the Son of David, we can see that the
importance of this passage is very great. And
that for two reasons. First, as testifying that
Christ should be no mere human descendant of
David, because David calls Him Lord; and,
secondly, as foretelling the Ascension of Christ
to the Throne at God&rsquo;s right hand. And not
only do all the three first Gospels record the use
which He made of this verse to silence the Jews;
but we find also that S. Peter on the day of
Pentecost, and also S. Paul in his Epistles to
the Corinthians and to the Hebrews (Acts ii.
34; 1 Cor. xv. 25; Heb. i. 13, x. 13), quoted
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[Pg&nbsp;78]</a></span>
it in support of their arguments that our Lord
was exalted to His Throne. The Apostles
argued in this way; David had thus clearly
foretold the Ascension of Christ, and that His
Ascension would be to the Throne of power, at
the right hand of God. Therefore, inasmuch as
He had ascended into Heaven, His Ascension
was clearly the fulfilment of the prophecy, in
order that He might make His solemn entry
upon His kingly office, and be seated on His
Throne. The Ascension was the last crowning
proof that Jesus was Messiah&mdash;the King of
the house of David&mdash;the &ldquo;Priest for ever after
the order of Melchisedek&rdquo; (Ps. cx. 4), that is,
&ldquo;King of Righteousness&rdquo; and &ldquo;King of Peace&rdquo;
(Heb. vii. 2).</p>

<p>In other words, the Apostles maintained that
the Ascension of our Lord was the act whereby
He ascended the Throne of &ldquo;The Kingdom
of Heaven,&rdquo; the Mediatorial Kingdom of
Messiah. And this is the testimony which they
have given under the inspiration of the Holy
Ghost. God &ldquo;raised Him from the dead, and
set Him at His own right hand in the heavenly
places, far above all principality, and power, and
might, and dominion, and every name that is
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[Pg&nbsp;79]</a></span>
named, not only in this world, but also in that
which is to come: and hath put all things under
His feet, and gave Him to be the Head over all
things to the Church&rdquo; (Ephes. i. 20-22). And
we are assured that the Ascension of our Saviour,
the Lord Jesus Christ, implied that He has won
the right of sovereignty over all the world; and
that all mankind are summoned to bow before
Him, and accept Him as their King. For,
because &ldquo;He humbled Himself and became
obedient unto death, even the death of the
Cross,&rdquo; therefore &ldquo;God also hath highly exalted
Him, and given Him a name which is above
every name, that at the Name of Jesus every
knee should bow, and that every tongue should
confess that Jesus Christ is Lord&rdquo; (Phil. ii. 8-11).</p>

<p>But for the successful setting up of &ldquo;The
Kingdom of Heaven&rdquo; two things were still
needed. First, the overthrow of the enemies of
Messiah&rsquo;s Kingdom; and secondly, the gift of
the Holy Ghost, to induce men to be willing to
submit themselves to the spiritual rule of our
Lord Jesus Christ. Consequently when the King
had ascended the Throne, and all mankind had
been given Him as His subjects, He was &ldquo;from
henceforth expecting till His enemies be made
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[Pg&nbsp;80]</a></span>
His footstool&rdquo; (Ps. cx. 1; Heb. x. 13). All who
are set against &ldquo;The Kingdom of Heaven&rdquo; must
in the end be subdued before Him. And no
doubt the wicked amongst men who oppose His
rule will, if they turn not, be included amongst
these enemies. And yet we must never forget
that these belong really to the number of those
who were given to Him as His subjects. This is
one of the mysteries of the Gospel, that &ldquo;whilst
we were yet sinners Christ died for us&rdquo; (Rom.
v. 8), and &ldquo;when we were enemies we were reconciled
to God by the death of His Son&rdquo; (Rom. v.
10); so that we are assured that the King in His
loving mercy would have the wicked not &ldquo;under
His footstool,&rdquo; but amongst the sharers of His
glory. But there are other enemies which will
certainly be subdued in God&rsquo;s own time; and
they are the spiritual powers of evil which are
hindering men from being His subjects. He
will &ldquo;put down all rule and all authority and
power&rdquo; (1 Cor. xv. 24) arrayed against Him;
even &ldquo;the principalities and powers and rulers of
the darkness of this world&rdquo; (Ephes. vi. 12), by
which His subjects are assailed. &ldquo;For He must
reign till He hath put all enemies under His
feet&rdquo; (1 Cor. xv. 25).</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[Pg&nbsp;81]</a></span>
But the destruction of His foes is not the only,
nor the chief result of His Ascension. When the
King ascended the Throne of &ldquo;The Kingdom of
Heaven,&rdquo; &ldquo;He led captivity captive and gave
gifts unto men&rdquo; (Eph. iv. 8), even the gifts by
which men might be brought to submit themselves
to His spiritual rule, and be saved by Him.
And inasmuch as only the Holy Ghost can
change the heart, and make men such as He had
described His subjects to be, He had previously
explained to His Apostles that there was one
gift on which all future success depended, the
gift of &ldquo;the Comforter which is the Holy Ghost&rdquo;
(S. John xiv. 26). And He had assured them,
&ldquo;It is expedient for you that I go away; for if
I go not away, the Comforter will not come unto
you; but if I depart, I will send Him unto you&rdquo;
(S. John xvi. 7).</p>

<p>They did not understand the words at the
time when they were spoken; but at the time
of the Ascension they knew that they were to
&ldquo;wait for the promise of the Father&rdquo; (Acts i. 4),
of which He had told them; and to &ldquo;tarry in
the city of Jerusalem until&rdquo; they were &ldquo;endued
with power from on high&rdquo; (S. Luke xxiv. 49).
Ten days of watching, suspense, and prayer
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[Pg&nbsp;82]</a></span>
followed. At last, &ldquo;when the day of Pentecost
was fully come, suddenly there came a sound
from Heaven, as of a rushing mighty wind, and
they were all filled with the Holy Ghost, and
began to speak with other tongues, as the Spirit
gave them utterance&rdquo; (Acts ii. 1-4). Hitherto
the little band of believers had numbered
&ldquo;about an hundred and twenty&rdquo; (Acts i. 15)
in Jerusalem. But now that the Holy Ghost
was given, who could move the hearts of men
and change them, the Apostles found themselves
endued with the promised &ldquo;power from on high,&rdquo;
which should give weight to their testimony;
and the vast multitude, who assembled to listen
to S. Peter&rsquo;s sermon, were &ldquo;pricked in their
heart, and said unto Peter and to the rest of
the apostles, Men and brethren, what shall we
do?&rdquo; (Acts ii. 37).</p>

<p>The previous instructions which had been
given them about &ldquo;the things pertaining to the
Kingdom&rdquo; (Acts i. 3) were now to be put into
practice. The Apostles had the answer ready:
&ldquo;Repent, and be baptized every one of you in
the Name of Jesus Christ for the remission of
sins, and ye shall receive the gift of the Holy
Ghost. For the promise&rdquo;&mdash;of the Holy Ghost,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[Pg&nbsp;83]</a></span>
who alone can change the heart and make men
to be born again as the children of God&mdash;is not
to us only, said the Apostle, but &ldquo;is unto you,
and to your children, and to all that are afar off,
even as many as the Lord our God shall call.
And with many other words,&rdquo; besides those
which are recorded, &ldquo;did he testify&rdquo; to the
truth about the Lord Jesus being Messiah, the
King; and with such force did he &ldquo;exhort,
saying, Save yourselves from this untoward
generation,&rdquo; that three thousand &ldquo;gladly received
his word and were baptized&rdquo; (Acts ii. 38-41),
as subjects of &ldquo;The Kingdom of Heaven.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Thus the Kingdom was established amongst
men by the power of the Holy Ghost<a name="FNanchor_17_17" id="FNanchor_17_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_17_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a>. A spiritual
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[Pg&nbsp;84]</a></span>
Kingdom, but none the less a Kingdom
upon earth. A spiritual Kingdom, not established
by any power of man, and not belonging
to this world; and yet a Kingdom of which
men and women and little children were the
subjects; &ldquo;The Kingdom of Heaven&rdquo; as described
by our Lord in His parables and discourses.</p>

<p>And the Kingdom having been thus established
amongst men, from this time we find a
special name was given to it. Henceforth &ldquo;The
Kingdom of Heaven&rdquo; becomes &ldquo;the Church.&rdquo;
It was a word which our Lord Himself had
occasionally used with reference to His Kingdom,
as when He said, &ldquo;Upon this rock
I will build my Church&rdquo; (S. Matt. xvi. 18);
but it now became the common expression.
Thus when a persecution broke out against the
Christians, it was thus described, &ldquo;As for Saul,
he made havoc of the Church&rdquo; (Acts viii. 3). So
Herod &ldquo;stretched forth his hands to vex certain
of the Church&rdquo; (Acts xii. 1); and when S. Peter
was imprisoned, &ldquo;prayer was made without
ceasing of the Church unto God for him&rdquo; (Acts
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[Pg&nbsp;85]</a></span>
xii. 5). And throughout the Book of the Acts
of the Apostles and the Epistles it is almost
always used as the name of the body of believers
or subjects of &ldquo;The Kingdom of Heaven.&rdquo;</p>

<p>At the same time, in order that there might
be no doubt that the Apostles were simply
carrying on their Lord&rsquo;s preaching of &ldquo;the
Gospel of the Kingdom&rdquo; (S. Matt. iv. 23), and
that &ldquo;The Church&rdquo; which they founded was in
very deed &ldquo;The Kingdom of Heaven,&rdquo; in certain
passages describing the character of their preaching
we still find a reference to the Kingdom.
Thus, when Philip preached the Gospel to the
Samaritans, his work is described in these words,
&ldquo;When they believed Philip preaching the things
concerning the Kingdom of God, and the
Name of Jesus Christ, they were baptized, both
men and women&rdquo; (Acts viii. 12). And a similar
instance occurs respecting the preaching of the
great Apostle to the Gentiles, S. Paul. The
whole of the latter half of the Book of the Acts
of the Apostles is filled with the record of the
extension of the Church by the labour of S. Paul
in the various lands he visited. And he himself
continually uses the word &ldquo;Church,&rdquo; both in his
addresses recorded in the Acts of the Apostles
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[Pg&nbsp;86]</a></span>
and in his Epistles to the Churches. Thus, for
instance, to the Elders whom he had ordained
to take charge of the Church at Ephesus, he
says, &ldquo;Feed the Church of God which He hath
purchased with His own Blood&rdquo; (Acts xx. 28).
And yet when the general character of his preaching
is described, it is still spoken of as the good
news of the Kingdom. For to these same Elders
S. Paul says, &ldquo;And now, behold, I know that ye
all, among whom I have gone preaching the
Kingdom of God, shall see my face no more&rdquo;
(Acts xx. 25). And the last record of him
leaves him at Rome &ldquo;preaching the Kingdom of
God, and teaching those things which concern
the Lord Jesus Christ, no man forbidding him&rdquo;
(Acts xxviii. 31).</p>

<p>We may now briefly sum up the results of the
Ascension of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ.
In ascending into heaven He was fulfilling the
prophecy, to which special prominence had
been given in His discourses with His opponents,
&ldquo;The Lord said unto my Lord, Sit Thou on my
right hand till I make Thine enemies Thy footstool&rdquo;
(Ps. cx. 1). He was thus ascending the
Throne of the Mediatorial Kingdom of Messiah&mdash;&ldquo;The
Kingdom of Heaven&rdquo;&mdash;and having
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[Pg&nbsp;87]</a></span>
ascended in triumph, &ldquo;He gave gifts unto men.&rdquo;
And upon receiving the great gift which He had
promised&mdash;even the Holy Ghost&mdash;the Apostles
became endued with the power, by which alone
&ldquo;The Kingdom of Heaven&rdquo; could be founded
upon earth, and be extended amongst men.
And, from that day forward, &ldquo;The Kingdom of
Heaven&rdquo; may be said to have been established.
And as the Apostles went forth preaching the
good news of the Kingdom of God, and believers
were multiplied, we find that, under the inspiration
of the Holy Ghost, the word &ldquo;Church&rdquo; was
used to express this body of the faithful. And
the name thus used in those early days of &ldquo;The
Kingdom of Heaven,&rdquo; has been generally applied
to it ever since.</p>

<p>Thus we are brought face to face with the
practical importance of the teaching of our
Blessed Lord about &ldquo;The Kingdom of Heaven.&rdquo;
&ldquo;The Kingdom of Heaven&rdquo; is &ldquo;The Church of
Christ.&rdquo; The subjects are ourselves.</p>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_17_17" id="Footnote_17_17"></a><a href="#FNanchor_17_17"><span class="label">[17]</span></a> It is sometimes said that the Kingdom was founded

(S. Matt. xvi. 18), and expressly declared that the Baptism
of the Spirit was the appointed means of entering
into it (S. John iii. 5), it seems more accurate to say that
our Lord founded His Kingdom on this day, through the
descent of the Holy Ghost upon the Apostles. For thus
His words which specially applied to their own cases
were fulfilled, &ldquo;Ye shall be baptized with the Holy
Ghost&rdquo; (Acts i. 5; S. Matt. iii. 11); and the gift was
then handed on to others in the appointed way, by which
they also might be brought into the one Body (1 Cor.
xii. 13).</p></div>

<p>We have seen that our Lord described in
His Parables the general character and nature
of &ldquo;The Kingdom of Heaven.&rdquo; Consequently,
if the Church established by the Apostles under
the guidance of the Holy Ghost is &ldquo;The Kingdom
of Heaven,&rdquo; it will necessarily be found to
agree with the description thus given. Let us
therefore now consider how far the history of
the Church, in the Acts of the Apostles and the
Epistles, agrees with the picture of &ldquo;The Kingdom
of Heaven&rdquo; drawn beforehand by the
King.</p>

<p>The Parable of the Sower admits of frequent
illustration if we understand the seed to refer,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[Pg&nbsp;89]</a></span>
in a general sense, to the good news of salvation
through Jesus Christ, whether it is preached to
men outside the Kingdom or to those within it.
The birds are continually carrying off the seed
from thoughtless and hardened hearers; opposition
and persecution and temptation still scorch
up the seed in others; and worldliness and love
of money still choke that which was beginning
to grow well in many hearts. And we can see
all these characters, in those who were first called
to be members of the Church of Christ. The
Jews, generally, in all places visited by S. Paul,
from whom he was forced to turn away in despair
of producing any effect (Acts xiii. 46), were like
the wayside on which the seed fell only to be
devoured. Such also was Felix, who &ldquo;trembled&rdquo;
as he heard S. Paul reasoning &ldquo;of righteousness,
temperance, and judgment to come,&rdquo; but went
away and &ldquo;left Paul bound&rdquo; (Acts xxiv. 25-27);
and Agrippa &ldquo;almost persuaded to be a
Christian&rdquo; (Acts xxvi. 28). Of hearers in whom
the seed is scorched up by the fire of temptation
or persecution, we may see instances in Ananias
and Sapphira, who fell under the temptation to
appear zealous whilst being really worldly (Acts
v. 3); or in John Mark, who was disheartened
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[Pg&nbsp;90]</a></span>
at the seeming difficulties before him, and turned
back from Pamphylia (Acts xiii. 13), leaving S.
Paul and S. Barnabas to go on without him. Of
those in whom the seed is choked by the weeds
of worldliness and love of money, there were
many examples. Simon Magus, who after renouncing
his sorcery and being baptised, thought
that the power of the Holy Ghost might &ldquo;be
purchased with money&rdquo; (Acts viii. 19, 20);
Demas who &ldquo;loved this present world&rdquo; so much
that he forsook S. Paul in the hour of danger
(2 Tim. iv. 10); and the many of whom S. Paul
spoke with tears, &ldquo;whose God is their belly,
whose glory is in their shame, who mind earthly
things&rdquo; (Phil. iii. 19). And, lastly, of those in
whom the seed bears fruit an hundredfold, it
seems almost invidious to select examples. But
such were the martyr Stephen, who prayed for his
murderers (Acts vii. 60); Tabitha, &ldquo;full of good
works and almsdeeds&rdquo; (Acts ix. 36); Cornelius,
upon whom the Holy Ghost fell even before he
was baptized (Acts x. 46); S. Luke, &ldquo;the
beloved physician&rdquo; (Col. iv. 14), &ldquo;whose praise
is in the Gospel&rdquo; (2 Cor. viii. 18).</p>

<p>The Parable of &ldquo;The Tares,&rdquo; which described
the sad outward appearance of &ldquo;The Kingdom
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[Pg&nbsp;91]</a></span>
of Heaven,&rdquo; was unhappily at once exemplified
in the early Church. Amongst the first members
of the Church of Christ were found Ananias
and Sapphira &ldquo;to lie unto the Holy Ghost&rdquo;
(Acts v. 3); and Simon Magus to bring upon
himself the rebuke &ldquo;thy money perish with thee&rdquo;
(Acts viii. 20). And, as years passed on, we
find S. Paul writing to the Church of God at
Corinth to rebuke its members of schism (1
Cor. i. 12); of being &ldquo;carnal&rdquo; and encouraging
&ldquo;envying and strife and divisions&rdquo; (1 Cor. iii.
3); of &ldquo;fornication,&rdquo; and that not merely in
a single instance (1 Cor. v, vi); of tampering
with idolatrous feastings (1 Cor. viii); of disorders
in their religious assemblies, and especially
of gross profanity in the celebration of
the Lord&rsquo;s Supper (1 Cor. xi); of strange misuse
of the miraculous gifts of the Holy Ghost
(1 Cor. xii, xiv); and of denying the great doctrine
of the Resurrection (1 Cor. xv. 12). All of these
charges show how strongly the tares began at
once to grow amongst the wheat. And, in later
years, the same Apostle warns the Elders of
Ephesus that &ldquo;grievous wolves&rdquo; will enter in
among them &ldquo;not sparing the flock&rdquo; (Acts xx.
29); referring probably to the Gnostic heresies
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[Pg&nbsp;92]</a></span>
against which the First Epistle of S. John is
mainly directed.</p>

<p>Let us pass on to happier examples. The
Parable of &ldquo;The Mustard Seed,&rdquo; describing the
outward spread of &ldquo;The Kingdom of Heaven,&rdquo;
is illustrated by almost every chapter of the
Acts. Beginning with the little seed of an
hundred and twenty members, the Church increased
at once to thousands on the Day of
Pentecost (Acts ii. 41, 47). Then, as the increasing
numbers required that Deacons should
be ordained to assist the Apostles, we read that
&ldquo;the number of the disciples multiplied in
Jerusalem greatly, and a great company of the
Priests,&rdquo; recognising, we may suppose, the fulfilment
of the sacrificial types in the person and
work of the Lord Jesus, &ldquo;became obedient to
the Faith&rdquo; (Acts vi. 7). Then by the Providence
of God this multitude of the believers was scattered
through the persecution which arose about
Stephen, and they &ldquo;went everywhere preaching
the word&rdquo; (Acts viii. 4). So that next &ldquo;Samaria
received the word of God&rdquo; (Acts viii. 14). Then
the good news spread to Damascus, and to
Antioch in Syria (Acts ix, xi. 19).</p>

<p>Such was the growth of the Church in the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[Pg&nbsp;93]</a></span>
first ten or twelve years. Then Antioch became
a fresh starting-point, and within the next
twenty years, under the efforts of S. Paul and
S. Barnabas and others, the glad tidings spread
from Antioch to Cyprus, and from Cyprus to
the coasts of Asia Minor (Acts xiii, xiv). Then
after extending through many provinces of Asia,
the Gospel tree spread forth its branches to
Macedonia (Acts xvi. 11); and from Macedonia
to the ancient cities of Greece (Acts xvii, xviii);
and from Greece to Italy and Rome, the capital
of the world. With this Parable of &ldquo;The Mustard
Seed,&rdquo; we may connect that of &ldquo;The Seed
growing secretly&rdquo; (S. Mark iv. 26, 27), and we
may think how little the rulers of the old world
imagined, that there was a power at work
amongst them, which would change the moral
character of the whole Empire. The Church of
Christ was extending her influence secretly and
unnoticed, or noticed only to be despised by the
ruling classes. Yet within three hundred years
the faith of Christ became the professed religion
of the Roman Empire.</p>

<p>But the spread of the Church of Christ was
not merely an outward extension in the number
of professed members. The Parable of &ldquo;The
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[Pg&nbsp;94]</a></span>
Leaven&rdquo; had set forth the power which &ldquo;The
Kingdom of Heaven&rdquo; would exercise over the
hearts of men. And of this also we may find
examples in almost every chapter of the Acts of
the Apostles and the Epistles. See the leaven
working in the first members of the Church, who
lived together in such love and unity that &ldquo;they
had all things common, and sold their possessions
and goods, and parted them to all men, as
every man had need&rdquo; (Acts ii. 44, iv. 32). Think
of the devoted lives led by the Apostles, &ldquo;rejoicing
that they were counted worthy to suffer
shame&rdquo; (Acts v. 41) for their Lord&rsquo;s sake.
Other instances may be seen in Stephen praying
for his murderers (Acts vii. 60); in the
character of Barnabas, &ldquo;a good man full of the
Holy Ghost and of faith&rdquo; (Acts xi. 24); in the
Elders, who were ordained by S. Paul in the
different cities which he visited, and who handed
on the knowledge they had gained to their more
ignorant fellow-countrymen, &ldquo;feeding the Church
of God&rdquo; (Acts xiv. 23, xx. 28); in the case of
Aquila and Priscilla instructing Apollos (Acts
xviii. 26); in the Ephesian converts burning
their books (Acts xix. 19); in Lydia taking care
of S. Paul at Philippi (Acts xvi. 15); and in the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[Pg&nbsp;95]</a></span>
love shown to him afterwards by the Philippians
in general, his &ldquo;dearly beloved and longed for,&rdquo;
his &ldquo;joy and crown&rdquo; (Phil. i. 3-8, iv. 1-10).
Other signs of the leaven working in the hearts
of the faithful may be gathered from a variety of
expressions in the different Epistles, pointing to
the changed lives of the members of the Church
(1 Cor. vi. 11); whilst the Apostles were continually
urging their converts to let the leaven
work more freely upon them, and become more
apparent in the holiness of their lives, in the
putting off &ldquo;the old man,&rdquo; and in the putting on
&ldquo;the new man&rdquo; (Ephes. iv. 22, 24).</p>

<p>The Parables of &ldquo;The Treasure&rdquo; and &ldquo;The
Pearl,&rdquo; which set forth the priceless value of salvation,
and the different ways in which it becomes
known to men, may be illustrated by
several instances in the early history of the
Church. One finds the truth, as it were, by
chance, like some hidden treasure. Such was
the man of Ethiopia finding, as he crossed the
desert, an apparently chance traveller able to
expound to him the prophecies of Messiah (Acts
viii. 27); and such was the jailor at Philippi,
stopped in the act of committing suicide to be
baptized by his prisoners (Acts xvi. 27, 30).
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[Pg&nbsp;96]</a></span>
Another finds &ldquo;The Pearl&rdquo; worth all the world
besides, only after long search. Such was S.
Paul, who sought for it in intense zeal for God,
and found it in the Voice which said, &ldquo;Why
persecutest thou Me?&rdquo; (Gal. i. 14, Acts ix. 4).
And such was Cornelius, whose prayers and
alms called down the blessing from above which
brought to him the knowledge of His Saviour
(Acts x. 30-48). Whilst the value which men
set upon the discovery was shown by the joy
with which all things were given up for the sake
of Christ, when men &ldquo;did eat their meat with
gladness and singleness of heart, praising God
and having favour with all the people&rdquo; (Acts ii.
46, 47); when they rejoiced &ldquo;that they were
counted worthy to suffer shame for His Name&rdquo;
(Acts v. 41); when being expelled with violence
from one city they went on to the next, and, instead
of complaints, &ldquo;the disciples were filled
with joy and with the Holy Ghost&rdquo; (Acts xiii.
50-52); and when one could say, who had given
up all his earthly prospects and high position
amongst his fellows, &ldquo;what things were gain to
me, those I counted loss for Christ&rdquo; (Phil.
iii. 7, 8).</p>

<p>The last Parable of the series, &ldquo;The
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[Pg&nbsp;97]</a></span>
Draw-net,&rdquo; referring as it does to the final separation at
the end of the world, cannot be illustrated by
example.</p>

<p>Of the other Parables of &ldquo;The Kingdom of
Heaven&rdquo; describing special circumstances which
affect the subjects of the Kingdom, only one,
&ldquo;The Marriage of the King&rsquo;s Son,&rdquo; seems to be
capable of illustration by examples. And this is
abundantly illustrated throughout the Acts of the
Apostles in the history of the extension of the
Church. As soon as the Gospel spread to
Gentile lands, we find the Jews in general persistently
refusing to accept the Lord Jesus as
Messiah and to become members of the Church.
Thus at Antioch in Pisidia, after the glad tidings
had been so published that &ldquo;almost the whole
city came together to hear the Word of God;
when the Jews saw the multitudes they were
filled with envy, and spake against those things
which were spoken by Paul, contradicting and
blaspheming.&rdquo; Then the literal fulfilment of this
prophetic Parable followed. &ldquo;Paul and Barnabas
waxed bold and said, It was necessary that the
word of God should first have been spoken to
you; but seeing ye put it from you, and judge
yourselves unworthy of everlasting life, lo, we
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[Pg&nbsp;98]</a></span>
turn to the Gentiles&rdquo; (Acts xiii. 44-46). And, in
a similar way, the last chapter of the Acts of the
Apostles records how the Jews in Rome brought
upon themselves the warning Words of S. Paul,
&ldquo;Be it known, therefore, unto you; that the salvation
of God is sent unto the Gentiles, and that
they will hear it&rdquo; (Acts xxviii. 25-28).</p>

<p>Thus we find the Parables of &ldquo;The Kingdom
of Heaven&rdquo; exemplified and fulfilled in the
history of the early Church. And any doubt
still lingering in the mind of the reader, about
the Church of Christ being &ldquo;The Kingdom of
Heaven,&rdquo; may be dispelled by the clear testimony
of the facts recorded in Holy Scripture.</p>

<p>If it is true that our Lord came to found
a real Kingdom, and if the Church described
in the Book of the Acts of the Apostles is this
Kingdom, it is clear that the quality of Unity
or Oneness is essential to it. It must belong
to the nature of the Church that it should be
One; because we cannot conceive in our minds,
in any practical sense, the idea of two Kingdoms
of Heaven.</p>

<p>This truth was illustrated by our Lord under
the form of a figure. &ldquo;I am the Vine; ye
are the branches&rdquo; (S. John xv. 5). The idea of
a tree implies oneness, and the branches have
no separate existence apart from the stem. Even
so the subjects of &ldquo;The Kingdom of Heaven&rdquo;
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[Pg&nbsp;100]</a></span>
can exist only through union with Christ Himself;
and wherever Christians are enrolled, in
whatsoever country they may be, all must belong
to the same Kingdom, because all are branches
of the One Vine.</p>

<p>Consequently, if the Church be &ldquo;The Kingdom
of Heaven,&rdquo; then, as it spread through the
world and different countries received the Gospel,
we shall expect to find that the various branches
of the Church founded by S. Paul and the other
Apostles were not independent one of another,
in the sense of being so many separate and distinct
bodies, but were all united together, as
forming the One Church or Kingdom of Christ.</p>

<p>The question now arises, Was this the case?</p>

<p>God in His Providence has not left us in any
doubt upon this point. We can trace this oneness
very clearly in the history of the Church
during its extension under the Apostles, as recorded
in the Acts of the Apostles. The following
incident serves as an example. After S. Paul&rsquo;s
return to Antioch at the close of his first missionary
journey, a dispute arose about the necessity
of teaching the Gentile converts to observe the
law of Moses. And it was determined by the
Church at Antioch that &ldquo;Paul and Barnabas
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[Pg&nbsp;101]</a></span>
and certain other of them should go up to Jerusalem,
unto the Apostles and Elders, about this
question.&rdquo; The first recorded Church Council
was then held to consider the matter; and after
full discussion, it was determined to send the
decision in a letter after this manner: &ldquo;The
Apostles and Elders and Brethren send greeting
unto the Brethren which are of the Gentiles in
Antioch and Syria and Cilicia.&rdquo; Then after
stating the case, the decision was thus given:
&ldquo;It seemed good to the Holy Ghost and to us,
to lay upon you no greater burden than these
necessary things; that ye abstain from meats
offered to idols, and from blood, and from things
strangled, and from fornication; from which if ye
keep yourselves, ye shall do well. Fare ye well&rdquo;
(Acts xv. 1-29). From which it is clear that all
the believers in the several Churches of Jerusalem
and Antioch and Cilicia were brethren together,
and fellow-subjects of one Kingdom, bound to
the observance of common laws framed by common
consent for the general good government
of the whole body. And it is equally clear that
the ties which held together these various communities
of Christians were the Apostles themselves,
who had founded them. The various
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[Pg&nbsp;102]</a></span>
Churches were one, because their founders were
fellow-workers, who acted in concert, taking
counsel together. But what bond of union held
the founders themselves together?</p>

<p>The answer to this question shows the ground
on which the essential Oneness of the Church is
based. And it is clearly this. The Apostles and
Bishops who founded the various Churches were
all commissioned officers of one King&mdash;the King
of &ldquo;The Kingdom of Heaven&rdquo;&mdash;and they were
commissioned, not to found Churches bearing
their own, names, independent one of another,
but to extend the King&rsquo;s dominion. And their
authority and power to act were wholly dependent
upon their acting in the King&rsquo;s Name,
and with His concurrence. For when the commission
was given to the Apostles to &ldquo;go into
all the world and make disciples of all nations,&rdquo;
these words were added by the King, &ldquo;And lo!
I am with you alway, even unto the end of the
world&rdquo; (S. Matt. xxviii. 20). From which we
see also that the continuance of the Unity was
secured, in the same way, through the Apostles&rsquo;
successors, after they themselves should be called
to rest. And whilst the Apostles and Bishops
were thus appointed as the agents to extend
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[Pg&nbsp;103]</a></span>
&ldquo;The Kingdom of Heaven,&rdquo; the King Himself
was the actual bond of union, securing the essential
unity of the Church, wherever subjects were
brought in. One King over all held all together.</p>

<p>As time passed and various branches of the
One Church were formed, there were also other
ties which were felt to bind Christians one with
another as one body. The Church was a spiritual
Kingdom; and by one and the same Holy
Spirit all had been moved to accept the King,
and all had been new-born as the children of
God. And as all had received the same Holy
Spirit, so all looked forward to the same hope
of eternal life; all having been called to enter
the same state of salvation, in which the prize
was within their reach. All had been taught
the same articles of Faith. All had been baptized,
with the same form, into the Name of
the Blessed Trinity. And so S. Paul summed
up their bonds of union in these words, &ldquo;One
Body and one Spirit, even as ye are called in
one Hope of your calling; one Lord; one Faith;
one Baptism; one God&rdquo; (Ephes. iv. 4-6).</p>

<p>But the unity of a Kingdom depends, not
merely upon having one Head and certain
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[Pg&nbsp;104]</a></span>
general laws and ordinances; but also upon the
ready obedience of the subjects. &ldquo;Every Kingdom
divided against itself is brought to desolation&rdquo;
(S. Matt. xii. 25). An earthly kingdom
is strong only when the people are united
together in loyally obeying the king, and the
laws, and officers of the kingdom. It is weak
when suspicion and factious opposition prevail;
or when the subordinate princes exercise their
authority without respect to the general good.
And, if it does not fall altogether, it is an
unhappy kingdom indeed, when these opposing
interests break out into open rupture and civil
war.</p>

<p>The case is exactly the same with &ldquo;The Kingdom
of Heaven.&rdquo; It is strong only as a united
Kingdom. And the last prayer of our Lord
before His Passion shows how well the King
knew beforehand wherein the weakness of His
Kingdom would consist, which would hinder
it from comprehending the whole world according
to His loving design. The essential unity
of the Kingdom was secured, as we have seen
above. But still the strength of His Kingdom,
as a united Kingdom, would depend upon the
loyal obedience of His subjects. And He knew
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[Pg&nbsp;105]</a></span>
that His subjects would be as much exposed to
the evil influence of false teachers, as the subjects
of an earthly king are to the seductions of the
misguided and seditious. And He prayed &ldquo;That
they all may be one; as Thou, Father, art in Me,
and I in Thee, that they also may be One in
Us: that the world may believe that Thou hast
sent Me&rdquo; (S. John xvii. 21).</p>

<p>An unhappy tendency to division was soon
manifested in the Church. And S. Paul wrote
to &ldquo;the Church of God which is at Corinth,&rdquo;
to rebuke them for imagining that the founders
of the Church were founding communities in
their own names, forgetting that they were the
mere ministers of the King. &ldquo;While one saith,
I am of Paul; and another, I am of Apollos; are
ye not carnal? Who then is Paul, and who is
Apollos, but ministers by whom ye believed,
even as the Lord gave to every man&rdquo; (1 Cor.
i. 12; iii. 1-5).</p>

<p>The tendency to form divisions in the Church
which so early appeared, increased rather than
diminished as years went on; though it was
checked, under the Providence of God, by the
frequent persecutions which broke out against
the Christians. The inevitable result followed.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[Pg&nbsp;106]</a></span>
&ldquo;The Kingdom of Heaven&rdquo; was weak, and
unable to maintain the conflict against the
heathenism of the world around it, as it ought
to have done. Christendom was divided against
itself. The National Churches, which had been
founded as Branches of one and the same
Church, were engaged in contests between
themselves. Then one Church usurped an authority
over other Churches, provoking in course
of time further disunion. And in our own days,
after eighteen centuries have passed since the
Church was founded, it is calculated that not
one-third of the inhabitants of the earth profess
the faith of Christ. So greatly have the unhappy
divisions which prevail amongst Christians
weakened the Kingdom of our Lord and Saviour
Jesus Christ.</p>

<p>But as Englishmen we are chiefly interested
in the Church of our own country. Consequently,
we must now come to the consideration
of a question which, probably, has already
troubled the minds of many readers of these
pages&mdash;If the Church is one, what is the position
of those who have separated from their own
National Branch of this one Church, or Kingdom
of Christ?</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[Pg&nbsp;107]</a></span>
It is a question of much difficulty, because
those who have been outwardly separated from
their brethren have been brought into a position
altogether different from any which is described
in the New Testament. For the subjects of the
Lord Jesus Christ are described therein as subjects
of one Kingdom, bound together by the
closest ties of loyalty to the King, and of brotherhood
with one another. At the same time,
the names by which Christians in this country
are divided into Church-people and Dissenters,
only add to the confusion. For to suppose, as
these names suggest, that Dissenters do not
belong in any sense to the Church of Christ,
is an idea which is repugnant to the minds of
all who know anything of their work. But
though the difficulty of the question is so great,
it is hoped that the previous chapters will have
prepared the reader to see his way to the answer,
which Holy Scripture enables us to form.</p>

<p>But first let us clear the way by calling to
mind the origin of the present lamentable state
of things. The difficulty has been created by
the inevitable imperfection of all things with
which man&rsquo;s freewill is concerned. For God
clearly intended that His Church should be
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[Pg&nbsp;108]</a></span>
one; and that it should work upon the world
with the irresistible force of an united Kingdom.
And inasmuch as we find, in our own days,
that this intention has been frustrated, there can
be no doubt but that it is our duty to do what
we can to bring back the conditions of our life
here into conformity with it. For Christian
people cannot be content with a state of things
which they find to be plainly contrary to God&rsquo;s
intention. Consequently, in considering this
question, it seems that the right course to take
is to give prominence to the bonds of union
which still exist between the different bodies
of Christians in this country; and instead of
magnifying the causes and extent of disunion,
to endeavour to draw men closer together.</p>

<p>Now it is clear from Holy Scripture, that
the Church of Christ consists of those who
have been made subjects of &ldquo;The Kingdom of
Heaven;&rdquo; and we have already seen that our
Lord explained that the form of admission into
His Kingdom would be by Holy Baptism.
Therefore, with respect to so-called Dissenters,
we conclude, that all have been brought into
the Church or Kingdom of Christ in this land,
who have used the means which He ordained
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[Pg&nbsp;109]</a></span>
for that purpose, namely, Holy Baptism. And
the names assumed by those who separate themselves
from their brethren cannot destroy the
effects of this great Sacrament. It appears also
that they have become in some degree partakers
with their brethren of those bonds of union
mentioned by S. Paul, &ldquo;One Body; one Spirit;
one Hope; one Lord; one Faith; one Baptism;
one God&rdquo; (Ephes. iv. 4-6). Though, unhappily,
their appreciation of some of these bonds of
union is slight; and they are deprived (either by
their deliberate will, or, more commonly, by the
accidents of their birth) of the many privileges
which they might enjoy, through communion
with their brethren in the Ordinances of religion
and in the common service of our Lord Jesus
Christ<a name="FNanchor_18_18" id="FNanchor_18_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_18_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a>.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[Pg&nbsp;110]</a></span>
At the same time, it ought to be clearly understood,
that we have no certain warrant of Holy
Scripture for more than this. For, as there is
no example in the Bible of any one professing
faith in Christ, and yet holding back from
being baptized into the Name of the Trinity,
it is not possible to describe the position of
the unbaptized with any certainty of assurance.
The offer of salvation through Jesus Christ is
thus briefly stated, &ldquo;He that believeth and is
baptized shall be saved&rdquo; (S. Mark xvi. 16);
that is, he will be placed in a state of present
salvation by being admitted into &ldquo;The Kingdom
of Heaven.&rdquo; But the case of any one believing
and not being baptized is not contemplated.</p>

<p>In the next place, still confining our thoughts
to our own country, we shall do well to consider
that the greater number of those who have separated
themselves from us have done so with the
hope of thereby doing God service; or else under
the idea that the separation is of small importance,
being more a matter of personal choice
than of principle. They have forgotten or have
been ignorant of the prayer of the Lord Jesus&mdash;&ldquo;That
they all may be one; that the world may
believe that Thou hast sent Me&rdquo; (S. John xvii.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[Pg&nbsp;111]</a></span>
21)&mdash;forewarning us that the result of divisions
would be the spoiling of His work for the
saving of the world. And, at the same time, it
is right that we should also call to mind that in
many instances in the past history of the Church
in this land, those who have professed to hold the
position of loyal subjects of &ldquo;The Kingdom of
Heaven&rdquo; have seemed to be equally careless of
this inevitable loss through the separation of
their brethren.</p>

<p>With these considerations in our minds, if we
now go on to test our opinions by the sure
warrant of Holy Scripture, fearlessly taking our
stand upon its distinct teaching, we shall see
how important it is that both so-called Church-people
and so-called Dissenters should be induced
to study carefully what is recorded therein
about &ldquo;The Kingdom of Heaven,&rdquo; or Church
of Christ. For, on the one hand, we shall find
that Holy Scripture clearly teaches that the
Church is a spiritual Kingdom, and that the
only way to receive the benefits of membership
is by being led and sanctified by the Holy Ghost.
And, on the other hand, we shall see that Holy
Scripture makes it equally clear that our Lord
described His Church as being a real Kingdom,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[Pg&nbsp;112]</a></span>
though a spiritual one; and that this Kingdom
was established with distinct laws and
ordinances, by His directions, and under the
guidance of the Holy Ghost. And consequently,
if, on the one hand, any are content with the
name of Church-people without seeking to
advance in the spiritual life, they are clearly
acting as the Jews, who trusted to being able
to say, &ldquo;We have Abraham to our father&rdquo;
(S. Matt. iii. 9). Similarly, on the other hand,
if men carelessly weaken &ldquo;The Kingdom of
Heaven&rdquo; by forming factions, or so-called denominations,
under different leaders, and known
by the names of their founders, they are clearly
bringing themselves under the rebuke of S. Paul,
&ldquo;While one saith, I am of Paul; and another, I
am of Apollos, are ye not carnal<a name="FNanchor_19_19" id="FNanchor_19_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_19_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a>?&rdquo; (1 Cor. iii. 4);
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[Pg&nbsp;113]</a></span>
or if they propose to themselves to form a holier
society, by expelling the tares from the wheat in
the Lord&rsquo;s field, they are disregarding the teaching
of His parable (S. Matt. xiii. 24-30), the
meaning of which cannot be doubtful. And, at
the same time, all who will take pains to study
Holy Scripture will find that to be a member of
&ldquo;The Kingdom of Heaven,&rdquo; or Church of Christ,
is no mere matter of choice, but of vital importance;
because no other way has been revealed
whereby we may be saved, but by accepting the
Gospel of the Kingdom, and by being admitted
into it, as those first converts were, to whom S.
Peter said, &ldquo;Save yourselves from this untoward
generation&rdquo; (Acts ii. 40, 41).</p>

<p>We are now in a position to sum up what has
been gathered from Holy Scripture about the
essential unity of &ldquo;The Kingdom of Heaven.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The idea of a Kingdom implies the necessity of
unity. And it was provided that the essential
unity of &ldquo;The Kingdom of Heaven&rdquo; should be
maintained through the Headship of the one
King over all. The King commissioned His
Apostles to make all the nations of the world
His subjects, and assured them of the authority
to do this by promising to be with them and
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[Pg&nbsp;114]</a></span>
their successors to the end of the world. And
wherever the Church spread, however defective
and imperfect it might be, it was still part of one
and the same Kingdom, owning the Lord Jesus
Christ as King. Besides this bond of union, one
Holy Spirit was working with more or less
success upon all the subjects, wherever they
might be; one Hope was held out before all, of
salvation; one Faith in the ever-blessed Trinity
was taught to all, and professed by all; one
Baptism enrolled all; one God was the object
of the worship of all.</p>

<p>But the unity of a Kingdom depends not only
upon the King and the laws and ordinances of
the Kingdom, but also upon the loyal obedience
of the subjects. And the subjects of &ldquo;The Kingdom
of Heaven&rdquo; have, in past times, so far
forgotten this duty, that it has come to pass that
for centuries the great branches of the Church
of Christ have had little, if any, outward communion
or fellowship with one another. And in
our own country the professed members of
Christ are divided into many bodies, not only
independent of one another, but oftentimes
opposing, rather than helping forward, the extension
and well-being of the Kingdom of our
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[Pg&nbsp;115]</a></span>
Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ. And the result
has been that we have learned by sad experience
the reason of the foreboding tone of our Lord&rsquo;s
last prayer, &ldquo;That they all may be one; ...
that the world may believe that Thou hast sent
Me&rdquo; (S. John xvii. 21). The multitudes of men,
practically heathen, in the midst of this professedly
Christian land, and the still greater
multitudes of men in other lands whom the good
news of the Kingdom has not reached, are proofs
of the weakness of the Church of Christ. Christians
are not &ldquo;one;&rdquo; and consequently &ldquo;the
world&rdquo; does not &ldquo;believe&rdquo; in Him whom the
Father of His great love sent to be its Saviour.</p>

<p>During the first few centuries the Church
spread rapidly, not only throughout the more
civilised parts of the Roman Empire, but also
amongst the rough Celts of Britain and the fierce
Teutons of Germany. We may well ask, why
did it cease to spread, and why are so many
lands still lying in darkness? Since Christ came
to be the Saviour of the world, how is it that
there are so many millions of Buddhists and
Hindoos in Asia, that to this day it is said that
not one-third of the inhabitants of the world are;
Christians? The answer is, alas! clear. The
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[Pg&nbsp;116]</a></span>
unity of the One Universal Church of Christ has
not been maintained in the full and perfect
manner described in our Lord&rsquo;s Prayer, &ldquo;That
they all may be one, as Thou, Father, art in Me,
and I in Thee, that they also may be one in
Us&rdquo; (S. John xvii. 21). Christians have lost the
sense of brotherhood, which should bind them all
together in Christ, of whatsoever nation or language
they may be. The Church has ceased
to move with the irresistible power of one
mighty army, acting with one mind for the
glory of God.</p>

<p>All thoughtful subjects of &ldquo;The Kingdom of
Heaven&rdquo; must lament this state of disunion and
weakness. And men are striving in different,
and in some cases opposite ways, to bring about
re-union. But when we begin to ask, What is
the remedy? we find that we are facing a mighty
problem. God&rsquo;s loving purpose for the salvation
of the world has been marred by man&rsquo;s wilfulness.
His Kingdom, which might have been
irresistible and have won the whole world for
Christ, has been split up into many portions,
which have been opposing and weakening one
another, instead of fighting His enemies. How
can these portions, after centuries of disunion, be
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[Pg&nbsp;117]</a></span>
reunited into one? How can the mischief be
undone?</p>

<p>It is beyond the power of man.</p>

<p>Yet at the same time we can see that there
are certain things which all can do to advance
the object in view, and to promote re-union at
least in our own National Church at home,
if not also between the different branches of
Christ&rsquo;s Holy Church<a name="FNanchor_20_20" id="FNanchor_20_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_20_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a> throughout the world.
But to do so, two things are clearly necessary.
One thing is to have a clear grasp of the principle
which runs through the whole teaching of
the Bible,&mdash;that Christ came to found a Kingdom.
And the other is to desire unity. If all
desired unity, the desired result would certainly
be accomplished.</p>

<p>But one thing is certain. No plan of re-union
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[Pg&nbsp;118]</a></span>
can succeed which is not based upon the clear
teaching of Holy Scripture. &ldquo;The Kingdom of
Heaven&rdquo; is there clearly described. First by the
King Himself in His parables and discourses,
before the Kingdom was yet founded; and then
in the history of the Acts of the Apostles, which
tells how the Kingdom or Church of Christ,
which had been purchased with His own Blood,
was set up under the guidance of the Holy
Ghost. And inasmuch as no man, nor any
body of men, can form a new &ldquo;Kingdom of
Heaven,&rdquo; the only position which a Christian
can hold, in agreement with Holy Scripture,
is the position of a subject of that Kingdom
which was so founded.</p>

<p>And when we call to mind that &ldquo;The Kingdom
of Heaven&rdquo; extended to our own land, by the
Providence of God, in early days, we see at once
that our aim, as loyal subjects of the Lord Jesus
Christ, must be to win back those who have separated
from us, to act as fellow-soldiers with us in
the one great army of our King, serving under the
same flag and the same officers, and fighting
with united energy for the glory of God.</p>

<p>But as in an earthly kingdom various opinions
may be held by different persons and parties,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[Pg&nbsp;119]</a></span>
and yet all may be loyal subjects of the same
King, and earnestly advancing the well-being of
the kingdom, so in the spiritual Kingdom of
Messiah unity does not mean that all must think
alike<a name="FNanchor_21_21" id="FNanchor_21_21"></a><a href="#Footnote_21_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a>. But there is one necessary condition,
namely this,&mdash;the essential unity of the Kingdom
must be kept in view. There can be but
one &ldquo;Kingdom of Heaven.&rdquo; Consequently, to
form separate and independent bodies cannot
fail to cause confusion and weakness. To act in
the Name of the King men must be united. If
we, who call ourselves by the Name of Christ,
desire to spread His Kingdom with the irresistible
force which belongs to it, we must show
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[Pg&nbsp;120]</a></span>
to the world that we are all one in interests&mdash;in
the common hope of Heaven; all one in
faith&mdash;in the common belief in the love of God,
as it is expressed in the work of redemption,
through the Father, the Son, and the Holy
Ghost; all one in Baptism into the great Name
of the ever-Blessed Trinity; and, above all other
bonds of union, all one in loyal devotion to the
one Lord and King, our Saviour Jesus Christ.</p>

at present, living in outward separation from the Ancient
Branch of Christ&rsquo;s Church in this land, to consider with
themselves what cause there is in their own case to
justify, before God, such a separation from their Brethren
in Christ.</p></div>

name of our Lord Jesus Christ, that ye all speak the
same thing, and that there be no divisions among you;
but that ye be perfectly joined together in the same

reader from supposing that any re-union is advocated
which would involve union with error. On the one hand,
we must &ldquo;stand fast in the liberty wherewith Christ hath
made us free&rdquo; (Gal. v. 1). We must firmly refuse to
accept any other foundation than that of the Creeds,
settled by an undivided Christendom. And on the other
hand, we must set ourselves with equal firmness against
allowing any &ldquo;Shibboleth&rdquo; (Judges xii. 6), made out of

sides of a truth. To know a truth perfectly men must
see it from every point of view. And the power of taking
such comprehensive views of truths is granted to few,
if any, here on earth. Probably this perfect knowledge
is reserved for us in Heaven; when all, who have loved
their Lord in sincerity, will find that their controversies
with one another here on earth have been due to their
imperfect knowledge and limited views of the truths

<p>A question often arises which is, in no little
degree, perplexing to Christian people. What
is the Holy Catholic Church? The words are
very often in our mouths; for they are repeated
continually in the Creed. What do we mean by
them?</p>

<p>The teaching of our Lord about His Kingdom,
and the description of the founding of
that Kingdom by the Holy Ghost, acting
through the Apostles, are the materials out
of which the answer must be formed. And it
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[Pg&nbsp;122]</a></span>
is hoped that the readers of these pages have
been led to see this already.</p>

<p>But there are two ways of dealing with this
question: first, as an article of faith; and
secondly, as a matter of fact. The Church is
an object on which faith is exercised; but if
faith is laid aside altogether, the facts of the
existence of the Church and its rapid extension
in our own day still remain to be considered.</p>

<p>We must deal with it first as an article of the
faith. &ldquo;I believe in the Holy Catholic Church.&rdquo;
It is an article of faith added to our profession
of faith in God, expressing our belief in the
reality of the Gospel. It is like saying, in other
words, that we believe that what our Lord
preached was literally true, and has come to
pass. Hereby we declare that the Kingdom
which He proclaimed is a real Kingdom, and
that we belong to it as His subjects, and share
in the salvation which He, the long-promised
Messiah, came to bring.</p>

<p>We have already considered the grounds on
which this faith is based. We have seen that the
Church founded by the Apostles was in reality
and truth &ldquo;The Kingdom of Heaven,&rdquo; which
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[Pg&nbsp;123]</a></span>
was described beforehand by our Lord in
His parables and discourses, and which He
declared could not be entered except through
a new birth of the Spirit. And we have seen
how the Holy Ghost was given according to His
promise, first to lead men to accept the good
news of salvation through Jesus Christ; then
to bring them into His Kingdom, new-born as
the children of God; and then to dwell within
them and influence their lives, and prepare them
for the presence of their Father.</p>

<p>Consequently, in professing our faith in &ldquo;The
Holy Catholic<a name="FNanchor_22_22" id="FNanchor_22_22"></a><a href="#Footnote_22_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a> Church,&rdquo; we are simply expressing
the belief of Christians, that the good news
which He preached has come to pass, that
&ldquo;The Kingdom of Heaven&rdquo; has been founded;
and that we, who profess this belief, have been
called to enter it as His subjects, and have
been put into the way of salvation, wherein
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[Pg&nbsp;124]</a></span>
we have a present share in His infinite merits,
and a good hope of eternal Life through Him.</p>

<p>The Holy Catholic Church is &ldquo;The Kingdom
of Heaven.&rdquo;</p>

<p>But we have also to deal with the words
&ldquo;The Holy Catholic Church&rdquo; as referring to
a matter of fact. The existence of the Church
is a historical fact, which may be traced down
through the eighteen centuries from the times
of the Apostles to our own. And we cannot
realize in any practical manner what the Holy
Catholic Church is, without some degree of
knowledge of its history. Consequently, we
must now proceed to consider what the Church
is, by the help of the records which have come
down to us.</p>

<p>The history of the Church of Christ during
the greater part of the first century is within
reach of all, because it is contained in Holy
Scripture, in the book of the Acts of the
Apostles, and in the Epistles. And this Bible
history of the Holy Catholic Church may be
divided into two periods; the first, whilst the
Church was confined almost exclusively to
converts from amongst the Jews, and had
hardly extended beyond the limits of Palestine;
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[Pg&nbsp;125]</a></span>
and the second, when it began to spread
amongst the Gentiles, in the heathen countries
of Asia and Europe.</p>

<p>During the first period the interest is centred
in Jerusalem. On the day of Pentecost the
foundation of the Church was laid in Jerusalem,
through the conversion of three thousand devout
Jews to the faith of Christ. And as
the Apostles went on preaching boldly to the
Jewish people, that the Lord Jesus whom they
had crucified was none other than Messiah, of
whom their prophets had foretold all things
exactly as they had happened, the rulers laid
hold of them, thinking to terrify them into
silence. But in vain; for &ldquo;the number of the
disciples multiplied in Jerusalem greatly, and
a great company of the priests were obedient
to the faith&rdquo; (Acts vi. 7). Then the persecution
arose about Stephen, one of the newly-ordained
deacons; and the faithful &ldquo;were scattered
throughout the regions of Jud&aelig;a and Samaria,&rdquo;
and they &ldquo;went everywhere preaching the
word&rdquo; (Acts viii. 1, 4). And so the Church
began to spread under the Providence of God
beyond the limits of Jud&aelig;a.</p>

<p>Meanwhile we find that the Church was
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[Pg&nbsp;126]</a></span>
growing into a duly organised body. It was
not a collection of Independent congregations,
but a Kingdom, ruled by laws and ministers
appointed either directly by the King Himself,
or under the guidance of the Holy Spirit. And
its subjects are spoken of under four divisions;
Apostles, Elders, Deacons, and Brethren. And
a brief description of these three orders of
Ministers and of the general body of brethren
will best illustrate the account given in the
Acts of the Apostles of what the Holy Catholic
Church was like during that period.</p>

<p>To the first order of Ministers&mdash;the Apostles
and their successors&mdash;our Blessed Lord had committed
His authority to found and extend His
Kingdom. For to &ldquo;the eleven Disciples&rdquo; the
commission was given, &ldquo;Go ye and make disciples<a name="FNanchor_23_23" id="FNanchor_23_23"></a><a href="#Footnote_23_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a>
of all nations, baptizing them in the
name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the
Holy Ghost; teaching them to observe all
things, whatsoever I have commanded you.&rdquo;
And then these words were added, showing
that the commission was to be handed on by
them to successive Apostles for ever: &ldquo;And
lo! I am with you alway, even unto the end of
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[Pg&nbsp;127]</a></span>
the world&rdquo; (S. Matt. xxviii. 16-20). And we
find that, as years passed on, the Apostles ordained
others to take their places; to assist
them during their lifetime in the various countries
and cities where converts had been made,
and to succeed them when they were gone.
The duties of these chief Ministers are clearly
described in the Epistles, which we possess to
two of them, viz. Timothy and Titus; being
such as the Apostles themselves fulfilled, and
including the general oversight of all teaching,
and matters of order, and the ordaining of
Elders and Deacons, as S. Paul sums them up to
Titus: &ldquo;For this cause left I thee in Crete, that
thou shouldest set in order the things that are
wanting, and ordain Elders in every city&rdquo; (Titus
i. 5). And in the first ages of the Church the
number of such overseers or Bishops was very
large; every chief city having one to rule over
the Church in that place, and to keep up the
unity with the whole body.</p>

<p>We come now to the second order of Ministers,
the Elders. When the numbers of the faithful
increased, it is clear that the Apostles by themselves
would be unable to instruct them in the
things commanded by the Lord (S. Matt. xxviii.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[Pg&nbsp;128]</a></span>
20); and we conclude that Elders were appointed
at once to assist them&mdash;probably from
amongst the seventy disciples sent out by our
Lord (S. Luke x. 1)&mdash;because, when mention
is made of them, S. Luke seems to take for
granted that his readers will know who they are.
The first mention of Elders in the Church at
Jerusalem is in connection with the alms sent
by the Christians at Antioch, to relieve their
poor brethren in the capital: &ldquo;They sent it
to the Elders by the hands of Barnabas and
Saul&rdquo; (Acts xi. 30). Elders are mentioned again
as taking part with the Apostles in the first
Council at Jerusalem, when &ldquo;The Apostles and
Elders came together to consider of the matter&rdquo;
(Acts xv. 6). And it is made quite clear that
Elders were regarded as a necessary order of
Ministers in the Church of Christ, by the account
given of the return of S. Paul and S.
Barnabas from their first missionary journey:
&ldquo;They returned again to Lystra, and to Iconium,
and Antioch, and when they had ordained
them Elders<a name="FNanchor_24_24" id="FNanchor_24_24"></a><a href="#Footnote_24_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a> in every Church, they commended
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[Pg&nbsp;129]</a></span>
them to the Lord&rdquo; (Acts xiv. 21-23). Their
office was to take charge of the different congregations
or Churches in the various towns and
villages, very much as is still the duty of the
second order of Ministers in the Church. We
may learn this from the words of S. Paul during
his last journey to Jerusalem. Having landed
at Miletus, &ldquo;He sent to Ephesus, and called the
Elders of the Church;&rdquo; and when they were
come he reminded them what his teaching had
been, and then charged them thus: &ldquo;Take heed
therefore unto yourselves, and to all the flock
over the which the Holy Ghost hath made you
overseers, to feed the Church of God, which He
hath purchased with His own blood&rdquo; (Acts xx.
17-28).</p>

<p>The appointment of the third order of Ministers&mdash;the
Deacons&mdash;was at first for a special
object; to take the management of the distribution
of daily necessaries to the widows and
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[Pg&nbsp;130]</a></span>
needy (Acts vi. 1-6). But, from the first,
the spiritual gifts bestowed upon them were
exercised in the more distinctly spiritual work
of preaching. Thus Stephen&rsquo;s &ldquo;faith and power&rdquo;
(Acts vi, vii) stirred up the first persecution;
and Philip, another of the first Deacons, by his
faithful preaching brought about the conversion
of the Samaritans (Acts viii. 5-14), and then
laid the first stone in the foundation of the
Ethiopian Church (Acts viii. 26-38).</p>

<p>Thus from the first beginning of &ldquo;The Kingdom
of Heaven&rdquo; we find the three orders or
classes of Ministers, which have been ever since
in the Holy Catholic Church. Apostles and
Bishops bearing the Lord&rsquo;s commission to
which the promise of His presence was attached;
Elders or Priests having charge of
congregations, as Pastors, to feed, instruct, and
lead; and Deacons having special oversight
of the relief of the poor, but also using their
talents to preach as God gave unto them.</p>

<p>The position and life of &ldquo;The Brethren&rdquo; are
set forth with equal clearness. As soon as a
man was induced, by the leading of the Holy
Spirit, to profess his belief in Jesus the crucified&mdash;as
being Messiah, the Son of God, our Saviour&mdash;he
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[Pg&nbsp;131]</a></span>
was baptized according to the Lord&rsquo;s instructions
to the Apostles (S. Matt. xxviii. 19).
He was thus enrolled amongst the subjects of
&ldquo;The Kingdom of Heaven,&rdquo; who were commonly
spoken of as &ldquo;Believers&rdquo; <em>or</em> &ldquo;The faithful,&rdquo; as
&ldquo;The Brethren,&rdquo; and as &ldquo;Saints.&rdquo; In this way
multitudes were brought into the Church on the
day of Pentecost (Acts ii. 41); thus Philip admitted
the people of Samaria (Acts viii. 12),
and the Ethiopian officer of Queen Candace
(Acts viii. 36-38). Thus S. Peter admitted the
Gentile Cornelius, his hesitation to do so having
been first removed by the manifest descent upon
him of the Holy Ghost (Acts x. 47, 48); and
thus S. Paul and S. Barnabas continually admitted
converts in their missionary journeys. It
does not appear that the Apostles themselves
baptized; but they directed the act to be administered
by an attendant. Thus S. Paul took
John Mark with him as his &ldquo;minister&rdquo; on his
first journey (Acts xiii. 5), and on other journeys
Silas and Timothy and others. When Cornelius
and his friends were baptized, we do not read
that S. Peter baptized them, but &ldquo;he commanded
them to be baptized in the name of the Lord&rdquo;
(Acts x. 48); and S. Paul expresses his
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[Pg&nbsp;132]</a></span>
thankfulness that only a few individuals could say that
they had been baptized by him in person, &ldquo;lest
any should say that I had baptized in my own
name&rdquo; (1 Cor. i. 14-17).</p>

<p>The life of &ldquo;The Brethren,&rdquo; after baptism, is
also described with much distinctness, in a few
words which seem to have been recorded once
for all of the first converts, in formal terms
which should be applicable to all others: &ldquo;They
continued stedfastly in the Apostles&rsquo; doctrine,
and fellowship, and in breaking of bread, and
in prayers&rdquo; (Acts ii. 42). And the four particulars
thus stated seem to include all the
duties of the Christian life. Their stedfast attention
to &ldquo;The Apostles&rsquo; doctrine&rdquo; implies that
they accepted their testimony as the truth necessary
for salvation. Their holding to &ldquo;the fellowship&rdquo;
or communion, implies their unity with
the Apostles, and with one another. Their
continual observance of &ldquo;The breaking of
bread&rdquo; implies the high position at once given
to the ordinance of the Holy Communion, instituted
by the Lord Himself as the bond of the
New Covenant, in place of the sacrifices of the
blood of beasts under the Old Covenant. And
their habitual joining in &ldquo;The prayers,&rdquo; implies
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[Pg&nbsp;133]</a></span>
that the assembling of Christians for common
worship was practised from the first.</p>

<p>Such was the life of the first subjects of &ldquo;The
Kingdom of Heaven.&rdquo; And this record of it
in Holy Scripture sets it forth as the pattern for
all future generations. It is true that the infant
Church was not perfect, and, had it been so, it
would not have corresponded with the description
which our Lord had given of it in His
Parables; but the leaven was at work upon
the hearts of the believers, and the result was
manifest in their lives.</p>

<p>After about ten years had thus passed, during
which the Church was being gradually developed
as the Kingdom of Messiah in Jud&aelig;a and Samaria,
the second period of its history, as recorded
in the Bible, began. And henceforth
Antioch became a fresh centre of interest and
activity, in consequence of the ordination of S.
Paul and S. Barnabas as Apostles. &ldquo;There
were in the Church that was at Antioch certain
prophets and teachers. As they ministered
to the Lord and fasted, the Holy Ghost said,
Separate me Barnabas and Saul for the work
whereunto I have called them. And when they
had fasted and prayed, and laid their hands on
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[Pg&nbsp;134]</a></span>
them, they sent them away. So they being
sent forth by the Holy Ghost, sailed to Cyprus&rdquo;
(Acts xiii. 1-4). Thus began the first missionary
journey into heathen lands. And from
Cyprus the good news of &ldquo;The Kingdom of
Heaven&rdquo; spread to Asia Minor, where in the
course of years the seven branches of the Church
were founded to which was addressed the Book
of the Revelation, vouchsafed to the aged
Apostle S. John (Rev. i. 4). From Asia the
Church extended into Europe, the Apostles
being called thither by the vision at Troas of
the &ldquo;man of Macedonia saying, Come over unto
Macedonia and help us&rdquo; (Acts xvi. 9). The
first victories of the Cross in Europe were gained
at Philippi and Thessalonica, and thence the
good news passed on to Greece, and the rich
city of Corinth became the Apostle Paul&rsquo;s headquarters
for &ldquo;a year and six months,&rdquo; the Lord
having &ldquo;much people&rdquo; there (Acts xviii. 10, 11).
From Greece the Gospel spread to Rome, the
capital of the ancient world. So that we
learn from Holy Scripture, that, within the lifetime
of the Apostles, the mustard-seed of the
Gospel had sprung up and grown into a tree,
whose branches overshadowed well nigh the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[Pg&nbsp;135]</a></span>
whole of the then civilised world, as it was
known to the Romans.</p>

<p>The answer to the question, What is the Holy
Catholic Church? is thus provided for us in the
Bible, whether we regard it as an article of the
faith, or as a matter of historical fact. The
Holy Catholic Church is &ldquo;The Kingdom of
Heaven,&rdquo; which was described beforehand by
our Lord in His parables, which was set up
on the Day of Pentecost, and then gradually
developed into an organised body, under laws
and ministers duly ordained by the Lord Himself,
or under the guidance of the Holy Ghost;
and which then spread from one land to another
through the exertions of the holy Apostles.
The Holy Catholic Church is that Kingdom
whose founding is described, and whose history
is commenced, in Holy Scripture.</p>

<p>But the history of the Church is only commenced
in Holy Scripture, and for a full explanation
of the Holy Catholic Church, regarded as
a historical fact, we need to have this history
continued down to our own days. Within the
limits of this little book, nothing but a very
brief outline of the history of the Church is
possible. But without doubt every Christian
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[Pg&nbsp;136]</a></span>
in this country ought to have such a general
knowledge of this history, as will enable him to
understand clearly how the Church of England
of to-day is united with the Church of Apostolic
times.</p>

<p>The history of the further extension of the
Church of Christ is contained in the writings
of various Christian authors whose books have
been preserved to us. Some few of these, such
as Polycarp and Clemens of Rome, were contemporaries
with the Apostles, and were ordained
by them. These were followed by
Justin Martyr&mdash;who in his &ldquo;Apologies on behalf
of the Christians&rdquo; gives a full account of
their manner of life, and worship, and ordinances&mdash;and
Irenaeus, and Clemens of Alexandria, who
lived between <span class="smcap lowercase">A.D.</span> 120 and <span class="smcap lowercase">A.D.</span> 200. Of the
next or third century, we have many books by
Tertullian, Origen and Cyprian, giving full accounts
of the faith and laws of the Christians,
their social life and their worship. And in the
fourth century, the historian Eusebius wrote
his History of the Church from the days of our
Lord down to the reign of Constantine, the
first Christian Emperor; and many of the great
theologians and defenders of the faith flourished,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[Pg&nbsp;137]</a></span>
whose names may well be &ldquo;household words&rdquo;
with Christians of all ages, such as Athanasius,
Ambrose, Jerome, Chrysostom, and Augustine.</p>

<p>From these or other ancient authors we learn
that Christianity rapidly spread to the northern
parts of Africa, to which country many of them
belonged; to France, and to Britain, where there
was a scattered British Church whilst the
Romans still held the country.</p>

<p>In course of time, the two great capitals of
the Roman Empire naturally assumed the chief
importance in the history of the Church; and
Rome became the chief see of the Western or
Latin-speaking Church, and Constantinople of
the Eastern or Greek-speaking Church<a name="FNanchor_25_25" id="FNanchor_25_25"></a><a href="#Footnote_25_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a>. And
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[Pg&nbsp;138]</a></span>
from that time forward, down to the Reformation
period, the history of the Church is contained
in numberless writings of successive
authors, in the decrees of Popes, in the records
of the great monastic orders, in the works
of the Schoolmen, and in the chronicles of the
various historians. And last, though not least,
we find it imperishably recorded in the cathedrals,
and abbeys, and parish churches, which
tell of the inventive genius and taste and skill
of our pious fathers in the middle ages<a name="FNanchor_26_26" id="FNanchor_26_26"></a><a href="#Footnote_26_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a>.</p>

<p>But our interest naturally attaches itself
chiefly to our own country, and to the records
we possess of the Church of England. The
Roman troops were withdrawn from Britain
about the end of the fourth century; and in
the course of the next two hundred years,
the various tribes of heathen Saxons who invaded
our shores overcame the resistance of the
Britons and settled in England; and, by their
victorious advance, the few that survived of the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[Pg&nbsp;139]</a></span>
British Christians were driven to take refuge in
the mountains of Wales and the western counties.
Toward the close of the sixth century the attention
of Gregory the Great, the good and zealous
Bishop or Pope of Rome, was called to the
heathen condition of Saxon England; and <span class="smcap lowercase">A.D.</span>
597 Augustine was sent over with a band of
clergy to convert the Saxons. He landed in
Kent, converted Ethelbert the king, and became
first Archbishop of Canterbury<a name="FNanchor_27_27" id="FNanchor_27_27"></a><a href="#Footnote_27_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a>. Shortly afterwards
Celtic missionaries&mdash;Aidan, Chad, and
others&mdash;pushed southwards, converting Northumbria
and the Midlands; others landed in the
southern counties; and the English people grew
into power as a Christian nation.</p>

<p>As years passed on, the Bishops, or Popes, of
Rome usurped to themselves an ever-increasing
authority, which was the cause of many contests
between them and successive kings of England;
and at the same time many abuses grew up
and superstitious practices were mingled with
the simple belief of purer ages, and a gradual
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[Pg&nbsp;140]</a></span>
decay of true spiritual religion set in. At length
in the sixteenth century the English Church asserted
its right to reform abuses under its own
Archbishops and Bishops. Then the Reformation
period began. The Pope of Rome endeavoured
to resist the movement, and to maintain
his authority; and upon the people of England
refusing to submit to his unreasonable and unbearable
claims, the rupture between the Church
of Rome and the Church of England resulted.</p>

<p>The position thus taken by the Church of
England must be clearly understood.</p>

<p>During the Middle Ages the various Churches
of the west of Europe were gradually brought
to acknowledge the supremacy of the Popes or
Bishops of Rome. So that the Pope was able
to exercise an authority over all these Churches.
Hitherto learning had been confined to a very
few. But now, through the invention of printing,
the knowledge of Holy Scripture was rapidly
extending; and people were finding not only
that the claims of the Pope were without foundation,
but also that many of the ceremonies and
practices, to which they were accustomed, were
superstitious and wrong.</p>

<p>This then was the work of the Reformation&mdash;to
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[Pg&nbsp;141]</a></span>
free the Church of England from the unreasonable
claims of the Papal Supremacy; and
to bring back the faith and worship of the people
into harmony with the writings of the ancient
Fathers of the Church.</p>

<p>The result was that new services were compiled
in English out of the old Latin books,
which the people had been unable to understand;
and much that was superstitious was
omitted. But the changes were introduced
gradually, and as the people were prepared to
accept them. The same Parish Clergy, in most
cases, ministered as before, only according to
the new forms; the Churches were used by the
same worshippers; the same Creeds were repeated.
For the Reformation touched not the
ancient Catholic Faith. It only removed the
modern ceremonies and superstitious beliefs
which had been added to it.</p>

<p>Like all great human efforts, the Reformation
was not unmixed with evil; but, at the same
time, the blessings gained by our country were
very great. And if other countries had succeeded
in reforming abuses, in a similar manner,
no doubt the Church of Christ would have
gained great influence for good, not only in
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[Pg&nbsp;142]</a></span>
Europe, but also throughout the world. But
the power, which the Church of Rome had
usurped to herself, was too valuable to be parted
with. The Pope denounced the Reformation,
and broke off all communion with our Church
and nation.</p>

<p>What then became the position of the Church
of England? We have seen how the unity of the
various branches of the Church was provided for
by our Lord, through the Apostles and Bishops,
to whom He entrusted His commission to extend
His Kingdom. And by the Providence of
God the unity of the Church of England with
the Holy Catholic Church has been maintained,
notwithstanding this unhappy schism between
us and the Church of Rome<a name="FNanchor_28_28" id="FNanchor_28_28"></a><a href="#Footnote_28_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a>. Our Archbishops
and Bishops still exert as before an indisputable
authority, as the officers of the King of &ldquo;The
Kingdom of Heaven;&rdquo; and having fellowship
with them, we know that we are in the same
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[Pg&nbsp;143]</a></span>
position as the first members of the Church, who
&ldquo;continued stedfastly in the Apostles&rsquo; doctrine
and fellowship&rdquo; (Acts ii. 42). Nothing but time
separates us from the Apostles and the early
Church of Christ. What was necessary for the
first subjects of &ldquo;The Kingdom of Heaven&rdquo;
we enjoy. What they were taught to believe,
we believe. What they were led to hope
for, we hope for likewise. The promise of our
Lord to His Apostles, &ldquo;Lo, I am with you
alway, even unto the end of the world&rdquo; (S.
Matt. xxviii. 20), includes our Bishops, with all
the other successors of the Apostles from that
day until now.</p>

<p>To the question, What is the Holy Catholic
Church<a name="FNanchor_29_29" id="FNanchor_29_29"></a><a href="#Footnote_29_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a>? the answer must be given, It is &ldquo;The
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[Pg&nbsp;144]</a></span>
Kingdom of Heaven&rdquo;&mdash;the Kingdom of Messiah&mdash;which,
according to His own prediction, has
spread from land to land through all the world.
And when we speak of the Church of England,
we speak of that branch of the one great spiritual
Kingdom which was founded, under God&rsquo;s
Providence, in our own land, in ancient times,
and which includes ourselves. For Bishop has
followed Bishop, and the Gospel has been
preached, and subjects have been brought into
the Kingdom of Christ, in this favoured land
of England, from one generation to another,
from the very beginning of our national life
until our own day.</p>

to translate the word <i>Hiereus</i>, which is the name in the
Greek of the Jewish Minister, and the mistaken idea that
the sacrifices he offered were propitiatory in the sense

meaning &ldquo;and the Son,&rdquo; into the article of the Creed
respecting the procession of the Holy Ghost. The
Nicene Creed, as drawn up in the original Greek, contains
only these words, &ldquo;proceeding from the Father.&rdquo;
The Latin Church added &ldquo;and the Son,&rdquo; without the
authority of a General Council. And though the contest
seems to have been about words, rather than any difference
of doctrine, at last, after a dispute of many years,
it ended in the schism between the Church of Constantinople
and the Church of Rome&mdash;between the East and

that a mighty responsibility has been laid upon our own
branch of &ldquo;The Kingdom of Heaven.&rdquo; We feel sure that
with the marvellous spread of the English nation, the
Church of Christ ought to have spread with equal rapidity;
and past neglect, especially with respect to the
great colonies founded in past generations in America,
brings us much to answer for. Yet we may take courage
when we think how the English-speaking branch of the
Holy Catholic Church has spread in recent times. North
America, Canada, and the West Indies; Australia, New
Zealand, and many islands of the sea; South Africa;
India, China, and Japan, all bear witness that the good
news of the Kingdom has been scattered, far and wide,
by English-speaking agents of the great King. And our
Archbishop of Canterbury is the acknowledged centre of
as wide a sphere of spiritual energy as the Pope himself.</p></div>

<p>The history of the extension of the Church of
Christ from one land to another, and of the successive
victories won by the Cross over heathen
races from age to age, gives by itself a very imperfect
idea of the meaning of the words &ldquo;The
Holy Catholic Church.&rdquo; Because, with the outward
extension of the Church, its influence upon
the inner man needs always to be considered.
For when our Lord described the extension
of &ldquo;The Kingdom of Heaven,&rdquo; He not only
likened it to the spread of a tree branching out
on every side, but He also declared that it would
work as leaven, secretly, by changing the hearts
of men.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[Pg&nbsp;146]</a></span>
This truth may be said to be kept prominently
before Christians by the term &ldquo;Holy&rdquo; being applied
to the &ldquo;Catholic Church.&rdquo; The Church of
Christ is of necessity and essentially &ldquo;Holy.&rdquo;
We see that this must be so, when we understand
what Holy Scripture says of it; that it is
builded entirely by the Holy Ghost (Eph. ii. 20-22);
that its members are &ldquo;called with an holy
calling&rdquo; (2 Tim. i. 9), &ldquo;called to be saints&rdquo;
(1 Cor. i. 2), that is, holy persons; and that a
day will come when the Lord Jesus, who &ldquo;loved
the Church, and gave Himself for it, that He
might sanctify and cleanse it with the washing of
water by the word,&rdquo; will &ldquo;present it unto Himself
a glorious Church, not having spot, or
wrinkle, or any such thing, but holy and without
blemish&rdquo; (Eph. v. 25-27).</p>

<p>But yet we know that at present the Church
of Christ is very far from being perfect. And
the mingling together of holy and unholy in
the Church is exactly in accordance with the
prediction of our Lord Himself. For whilst
He spoke of the power of His grace to
change and sanctify the hearts of the subjects
of &ldquo;The Kingdom of Heaven,&rdquo; He also expressly
foretold that there would be tares in
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[Pg&nbsp;147]</a></span>
His field amongst the wheat (S. Matt. xiii. 24-30),
which would remain as long as the world
lasts; and that the Gospel net would enclose
bad fish as well as good, and both would be
retained in it until the Angels make the separation
at the end (S. Matt. xiii. 47-50). The truth
of His teaching has been confirmed by the subsequent
history of the Church in all ages. Holy
and unholy are together; and though we are forbidden
to attempt to separate them, we know
that there is, as it were, a gulf between them,
which though not impassable is very great. The
words of S. Paul to the Jews, &ldquo;They are not all
Israel, which are of Israel&rdquo; (Rom. ix. 6), apply
to God&rsquo;s people still. And as he went on to
quote from the prophet Isaiah, &ldquo;Though the
number of the children of Israel be as the sand
of the sea, a remnant shall be saved&rdquo; (Rom. ix.
27), so, we know by experience, that it is still
the &ldquo;remnant&rdquo; only, which really live up to
&ldquo;the high calling of God in Christ Jesus,&rdquo;
and &ldquo;press toward the mark for the prize&rdquo;
(Phil. iii. 14). &ldquo;Many are called, but few chosen&rdquo;
(S. Matt. xxii. 14).</p>

<p>Consequently, since there are unholy as well
as holy members of &ldquo;The Holy Catholic
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[Pg&nbsp;148]</a></span>
Church,&rdquo; the question arises, What is the portion
of those who are, what they are called to
be, &ldquo;Saints&rdquo;? And how shall we express it?
Shall we accept the theory of some who say
that there are two Churches; an outward and
visible Church which is a mixed company of
good and bad; and an inner and invisible
Church which is known to God alone, and
which consists of the good only? A moment&rsquo;s
consideration of what has been pointed out in
previous chapters to be the teaching of Holy
Scripture, about &ldquo;The Kingdom of Heaven,&rdquo;
will show that the idea is untenable; because
it is &ldquo;The Kingdom of Heaven&rdquo; which is distinctly
described as imperfect in its present state
here on earth; and we cannot conceive the idea
of two universal Kingdoms of Messiah. What
then is the teaching of Holy Scripture respecting
the position of the &ldquo;Saints,&rdquo; who really are,
what they are called to be, holy?</p>

<p>It is expressed in the words of the Creed, &ldquo;I
believe in the Communion of Saints.&rdquo;</p>

<p>They who live as Christians, that is, as belonging
to Christ, enjoy &ldquo;The Communion of
Saints.&rdquo; All subjects of &ldquo;The Kingdom of
Heaven&rdquo; may enjoy this position of the Saints,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[Pg&nbsp;149]</a></span>
if they will. If they are unnatural children of
their Heavenly Father, if they are disloyal
subjects of their King, if they resist, instead of
being led by, the Holy Spirit, they are hindering
God&rsquo;s good-will concerning them, and making
of none effect the sufferings of their Saviour.
But if they look up to and love their Father, if
they set themselves to serve their King, if they
strive to follow the guidance of the Spirit, they
are in the way of salvation, and have &ldquo;The
Communion of Saints.&rdquo;</p>

<p>But what is &ldquo;The Communion of Saints&rdquo;?</p>

<p>No little confusion has been brought into the
consideration of these words by the very prevalent
idea that the Saints are, necessarily, departed
Saints who have finished their course in God&rsquo;s
faith and fear. But this is not the usual Bible
sense of the word. For instance, in the Psalms
it is commonly used for the name of those who
believe in and worship God. &ldquo;Sing to the Lord,
O ye Saints&rdquo; (Ps. xxx. 4). &ldquo;O love the Lord,
all ye His Saints&rdquo; (Ps. xxxi. 23). &ldquo;The Lord
forsaketh not His Saints&rdquo; (Ps. xxxvii. 28). And
in the Book of the Acts of the Apostles and the
Epistles it is continually used in the same sense,
for the Lord&rsquo;s people in general. &ldquo;Peter came
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[Pg&nbsp;150]</a></span>
down to the Saints which dwelt at Lydda&rdquo;
(Acts ix. 32). And at Joppa, &ldquo;He called the
Saints and widows&rdquo; to him (Acts ix. 41). And
S. Paul speaks of his work as a persecutor in
these words, &ldquo;Many of the Saints did I shut up
in prison&rdquo; (Acts xxvi. 10). And in most of
his Epistles he addresses those to whom he is
writing as &ldquo;called to be Saints&rdquo; (Rom. i. 7;
1 Cor. i. 2).</p>

<p>Another frequent cause of misunderstanding
is the idea that &ldquo;the Saints&rdquo; mean only a few
very holy persons, who have attained by the
grace of God such a degree of perfection, as is
beyond the reach of those who live an active life
in the world. But this idea also is found to be
contrary to the ordinary Bible use of the word.
Those whom S. Paul addresses in his Epistles as
&ldquo;Saints,&rdquo; are rebuked for almost every kind of
sin. The Corinthians, especially, are an instance
of the imperfections which may yet be found in
God&rsquo;s Saints, and may teach us how tenderly we
need to deal with the failings of those who are
just emerging from heathenism in our own days.
The First Epistle to the Corinthians administers
rebukes for schism, fornication, idolatrous
tendencies, misuse of spiritual gifts, profanation
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[Pg&nbsp;151]</a></span>
of the worship of God, and misbelief. And even
the Saints at Ephesus, who are addressed as if
they had made great advance in the understanding
of the mysteries of the faith, are warned to
abstain from lying, violent anger, stealing, foul
speaking, and unkind behaviour (Eph. iv. 25-32).
From which we learn to give a very wide meaning
to the word &ldquo;Saints;&rdquo; and to understand
by it, Christian people who, with many imperfections
and frequent falls, are seeking to gain
a better knowledge and deeper love of God;
and are striving to be led by the Holy Spirit to
resist sin and advance in holiness.</p>

<p>And what is &ldquo;The Communion&rdquo; which such
persons enjoy?</p>

<p>It is Communion with God, so that their &ldquo;life
is hid with Christ in God&rdquo; (Col. iii. 3). They
are declared to be united with God, as a branch
is united with its stem; deriving spiritual life&mdash;a
new and higher life than the natural life which
belongs to all&mdash;from Him. They are &ldquo;begotten
again&rdquo; (1 Pet. i. 3), and &ldquo;born of God&rdquo; (S. John
i. 13); and the seed of this eternal life is not left
dormant in them, as it is in the careless and
ungodly; for they remain not as &ldquo;children,&rdquo; but
&ldquo;grow up unto Him in all things&rdquo; (Eph. iv. 14,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[Pg&nbsp;152]</a></span>
15); and letting &ldquo;the mind that was in Christ
Jesus&rdquo; (Phil. ii. 5) be in them, and &ldquo;being
strengthened with might by His Spirit in the
inner man, Christ dwells in their heart by faith&rdquo;
(Eph. iii. 16, 17); and they are advancing &ldquo;unto
the perfect man, unto the measure of the stature
of the fulness of Christ&rdquo; (Eph. iv. 13).</p>

<p>The closeness of this union or communion
with God in Christ is expressed more fully by
the figure of the body and its members. The
Saints together form the Body of Christ. &ldquo;For
as the body is one, and hath many members,
and all the members of that one body, being
many, are one body: so also is Christ. For by
one Spirit are we all baptized into one body&rdquo;
(1 Cor. xii. 12, 13). Christ is the Head: and
the Church is the Body. For God &ldquo;gave Him
to be the Head over all things to the Church,
which is His Body&rdquo; (Ephes. i. 22, 23). So intimately
connected are the Saints with their
Lord that they are the members of Christ&mdash;yea,
S. Paul does not hesitate to say, &ldquo;We are members
of His Body, of His Flesh, and of His
Bones&rdquo; (Ephes. v. 30). This is a great mystery;
but when faith has accepted it, it is seen to be
the ground of the Christian&rsquo;s strength. He is
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[Pg&nbsp;153]</a></span>
strong through grace, because his strength is not
his own, but is derived from Christ his Lord,
with Whom through the Spirit he is united.</p>

<p>The importance of the two holy Sacraments
of Christ is in connection with this truth. Holy
Baptism is the means ordained for uniting us
with the Body of Christ (1 Cor. xii. 13). Holy
Communion is the means of maintaining this
union, and of drawing supplies of grace from
Him (1 Cor. x. 16, 17), as will be considered
more fully presently.</p>

<p>Thus through a right use of the means ordained
by Christ Himself the Saints are His
own members<a name="FNanchor_30_30" id="FNanchor_30_30"></a><a href="#Footnote_30_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a>. &ldquo;Why persecutest thou <em>Me</em>?&rdquo;
said the Lord to the persecutor of His people.
And they have the good hope to cheer them, that
when the great day of judgment comes, whilst to
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[Pg&nbsp;154]</a></span>
some who address the Judge, &ldquo;Lord, Lord,&rdquo; as if
they had always served Him, it will be said, &ldquo;I
never knew you, depart from Me&rdquo; (S. Matt. vii.
22, 23); the Saints, on the other hand, will be
recognised as being like Him&mdash;as bearing God&rsquo;s
image&mdash;and will receive the welcome, &ldquo;Come,
ye blessed of My Father, inherit the Kingdom
prepared for you&rdquo; (S. Matt. xxv. 34).</p>

<p>The meaning of &ldquo;The Communion of Saints&rdquo;
becomes clearer when we know that &ldquo;Communion&rdquo;
is the same word as that which is more
often translated &ldquo;Fellowship.&rdquo; The Apostle
S. John speaks with great clearness about this
Communion or Fellowship. Referring to the
good tidings delivered by himself and the other
Apostles about the person and work of the Saviour,
he saith, &ldquo;That which we have seen and
heard declare we unto you, that ye also may have
fellowship with us.&rdquo; In other words, he declares
that the Gospel was preached that all might
enjoy the Communion or Fellowship which the
Apostles possessed. And then he goes on to explain
with whom they enjoyed this Communion:
&ldquo;And truly our Fellowship is with the Father,
and with His Son Jesus Christ&rdquo; (1 S. John i. 3).
And this assertion of the Communion of the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[Pg&nbsp;155]</a></span>
Christian with God agrees with the words of
the prayer of our Lord for His people, recorded
by the same Apostle; wherein He
prayed, &ldquo;That they may be one, even as we are
one; I in them, and Thou in Me, that they may
be made perfect in one&rdquo; (S. John xvii. 22, 23).</p>

<p>These thoughts of the Communion of the
Christian with God&mdash;the Father and the Son&mdash;would
be incomplete, did we not also think
of our Communion with the Holy Ghost. For
inasmuch as the whole spiritual life of the
Christian is due to the indwelling of the Holy
Ghost, this Communion with God, which the
Christian enjoys, is in reality the work and
gift of the Holy Ghost. And this is testified
to us by the familiar words of blessing, &ldquo;The
grace of the Lord Jesus Christ, and the love
of God, and the Communion&rdquo; (or Fellowship)
&ldquo;of the Holy Ghost, be with you all&rdquo; (2 Cor.
xiii. 14).</p>

<p>Furthermore, &ldquo;The Communion of Saints&rdquo;
describes the fellowship or tie of brotherhood
which unites Christians together, one with
another. For if all Saints have Communion
with God, it follows that all have Communion
one with another in Him. If Christians are
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[Pg&nbsp;156]</a></span>
really striving to be, what they are called to be,
holy, they are all one family; united together
by the common bond of sonship; &ldquo;For ye are
all the children of God by faith in Christ Jesus&rdquo;
(Gal. iii. 26). Their adoption into the one family
of God is to them a real relationship. And this
also is expressed very clearly by S. John: &ldquo;If
we say we have fellowship with Him, and
walk in darkness, we lie; but if we walk
in the light, we have fellowship one with another&rdquo;
(1 S. John i. 6, 7). And inasmuch as
death does not sever the union between the
Saint and God, but rather intensifies it (seeing
that S. Paul describes the result of death as the
&ldquo;being with Christ,&rdquo; Phil. i. 23), it follows that
&ldquo;The Communion of Saints&rdquo; is not a fellowship
with the living only, but with the departed also.
&ldquo;All are one in Christ Jesus&rdquo; (Gal. iii. 28);
whether Jews or Gentiles, whether living or departed.</p>

<p>Having now concluded, from the teaching
of Holy Scripture, that &ldquo;The Communion of
Saints&rdquo; is that fellowship which Christians
enjoy, through being made one with God, and
with one another; we shall do well to consider
more carefully about the means by which they
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[Pg&nbsp;157]</a></span>
are enabled to keep up this union, and to
maintain the sense of its reality from age to
age. When our Blessed Lord spoke in the
synagogue at Capernaum respecting the Bread
of Life, He used these words, &ldquo;Verily, verily,
I say unto you, Except ye eat the Flesh of the
Son of Man, and drink His Blood, ye have no
life in you;&rdquo; and then He added, &ldquo;He that
eateth My Flesh, and drinketh My Blood,
dwelleth in Me, and I in Him&rdquo; (S. John vi. 53, 56).
His hearers had no idea about what He meant
by His Flesh and Blood. But in instituting the
Holy Sacrament of the Lord&rsquo;s Supper, He explained
the words Himself. For &ldquo;He took
bread, and blessed it, and brake it, and gave it
to His disciples, and said, This is My Body; and
He took the cup, saying, This is My Blood&rdquo; (S.
Matt. xxvi. 26-28). And consequently S. Paul,
referring to this Holy Sacrament, appealed to
the Corinthians to remember the bond of union
with God, and with one another, in which they
were joining, saying, &ldquo;The cup of blessing which
we bless, is it not the Communion of the Blood
of Christ? The bread which we break, is it not
the Communion of the Body of Christ? For we
being many are one Bread and one Body, for we
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[Pg&nbsp;158]</a></span>
are all partakers of that one Bread&rdquo; (1 Cor. x.
16, 17). And, therefore, we conclude that this
Holy Sacrament is the bond of union, ordained
by our Lord Himself, to maintain outwardly and
visibly, as well as inwardly and spiritually, &ldquo;The
Communion of Saints&rdquo; with God and with one
another. And this is clearly expressed by the
name &ldquo;Holy Communion&rdquo; by which we commonly
speak of this Holy Sacrament.</p>

<p>Does any one ask, What is &ldquo;The Communion
of Saints?&rdquo; The answer is clear. It is the
Communion or fellowship which Christians enjoy
with God, and therefore with one another,
whether in this world or in Paradise. And the
Sacrament of the Holy Communion is the ordained
means whereby this union is maintained
by the Saints on earth.</p>

<p>It is a sad but manifest fact, that it is in the
power of men to &ldquo;frustrate the grace of God&rdquo;
(Gal. ii. 21), and to make His good-will concerning
them to be of none effect. So that
whilst all who are called to enter the Kingdom
of the Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ are called
to enjoy the blessings which He has gained for
us, the multitude make little or no use of His
gifts. But all who will, may by His grace be
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[Pg&nbsp;159]</a></span>
assured of sharing in all the benefits of His
Sacrifice. &ldquo;If we walk in the light, as He is
in the light, we have fellowship one with another,
and the blood of Jesus Christ His Son
cleanseth us from all sin&rdquo; (1 S. John i. 7).</p>

<p>And as the Saints, by virtue of this Communion
with God, have the assurance of &ldquo;The
forgiveness of sins;&rdquo; so likewise they look joyfully
forward in hope of &ldquo;The Resurrection of
the Body&rdquo; and &ldquo;The Life Everlasting.&rdquo; For
&ldquo;The dead in Christ shall rise first; then we
which are alive and remain shall be caught up
together with them in the clouds, to meet the
Lord in the air; and so shall we ever be with
the Lord&rdquo; (1 Thess. iv. 16, 17).</p>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_30_30" id="Footnote_30_30"></a><a href="#FNanchor_30_30"><span class="label">[30]</span></a> Consequently the expression &ldquo;in Christ&rdquo; or &ldquo;in the
Lord&rdquo; is frequently used to denote the fact of a person
being a Christian. Thus S. Paul sends greeting to certain,

words, &ldquo;Salute Andronicus and Junia who were in Christ
before me&rdquo; (Rom. xvi. 7); and describes the Christians
of Palestine, at the time of his visit, as &ldquo;the Churches
of Jud&aelig;a which were in Christ&rdquo; (Gal. i. 22). And thus
of the Christian departed it is said, &ldquo;Blessed are the
dead which die in the Lord&rdquo; (Rev. xiv. 13).</p></div>

<p>&ldquo;The Kingdom of Heaven,&rdquo; what is it?</p>

<p>It is the Holy Catholic and Apostolic Church
of Christ. It is that Kingdom which was prophetically
set forth by our Lord in His parables;
that Kingdom, the subjects of which were
described in His teaching, and redeemed by His
Blood to be His own &ldquo;purchased possession&rdquo;
(Eph. i. 14); that Kingdom which was founded
through the coming of the Holy Ghost&mdash;being a
spiritual Kingdom not of the world, though at
present in the world&mdash;and which was preached
from land to land as an Universal Kingdom,
intended to embrace the whole race of man.</p>

<p>The purpose for which our Blessed Lord came
down from Heaven, and &ldquo;humbled Himself even
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[Pg&nbsp;161]</a></span>
to the death upon the cross&rdquo; (Phil. ii. 8), was
that He might found this Kingdom. &ldquo;He purchased&rdquo;
it at no less a cost than &ldquo;with His own
blood&rdquo; (Acts xx. 28). For He &ldquo;loved the Church
and gave Himself for it<a name="FNanchor_31_31" id="FNanchor_31_31"></a><a href="#Footnote_31_31" class="fnanchor">[31]</a>&rdquo; (Ephes. v. 25).</p>

<p>In other words, the salvation which is proclaimed
in Holy Scripture, as the great gift of
God&rsquo;s love, is offered unto man through the
means of a Kingdom of which our Lord Jesus
Christ is the King, and all the men and women
and little children in the world are intended to
be the subjects. The Son of God became the
Son of Man, that in Him the words of the
Psalmist might be fulfilled, &ldquo;I will give Thee
the heathen for Thine inheritance, and the uttermost
parts of the earth for Thy possession&rdquo; (Ps.
ii. 8); and those other words (which are quoted
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[Pg&nbsp;162]</a></span>
by S. Paul in the Epistle to the Hebrews),
&ldquo;Thou hast put all things under His feet&rdquo; (Ps.
viii. 6).</p>

<p>&ldquo;But we see not yet all things put under
Him&rdquo; (Heb. ii. 8). Although He &ldquo;gave Himself
for us that He might redeem us from all
iniquity, and purify unto Himself a peculiar
people zealous of good works&rdquo; (Tit. ii. 14), the
perversity of man has spoilt the perfection of
His work, and hindered the results of His self-sacrifice.
Eighteen hundred years have passed,
and still His rule is imperfect; and not one
third of the human race, whom He redeemed
unto Himself with His own blood, accept Him
as their King. But in His perfect foreknowledge,
this hindering of His work of love for the
salvation of man was present from the first; and
was foretold by Him in part in His parables.
And it pleased Him to entrust to His faithful
people the task of removing and overcoming by
their prayers and exertions the obstacles which
opposed His rule.</p>

<p>When the Pharisees once asked &ldquo;When the
Kingdom of God should come, He answered
them and said, The Kingdom of God cometh
not with observation; neither shall they say, Lo
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[Pg&nbsp;163]</a></span>
here! or, Lo there! for behold the Kingdom of
God is among<a name="FNanchor_32_32" id="FNanchor_32_32"></a><a href="#Footnote_32_32" class="fnanchor">[32]</a> you&rdquo; (S. Luke xvii. 20, 21). His
Kingdom was already being set up amongst
them, though they knew it not; and ever since
those days it has been spreading amongst men.
But He knew how strongly the great enemy of
God and man would oppose the extension of His
Kingdom; and how powerful the perversity of
man would be to hinder it; and when His disciples
asked to be taught to pray, these were the
words He bade them pray, &ldquo;Thy Kingdom
come&rdquo; (S. Matt. vi. 10).</p>

<p>It follows, therefore, that it is a matter of
great importance that we understand clearly the
meaning of these words. We cannot suppose
for a moment that our Lord meant that the
Kingdom of God is not <em>come</em> at all in this
present time. Because many passages, which
have been already quoted, have assured us that
His Kingdom was founded long ago amongst
men. Moreover, He expressly directed His disciples
to assure those to whom they preached,
whether they hearkened or not&mdash;&ldquo;The Kingdom
of God is come nigh unto you&rdquo; (S. Luke x. 9, 11).</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[Pg&nbsp;164]</a></span>
What then is the meaning of the prayer, &ldquo;Thy
Kingdom come&rdquo;?</p>

<p>The Kingdom of God is come already, and
men are everywhere &ldquo;pressing into it&rdquo; (S. Luke
xvi. 16). But His rule over the hearts of men
is imperfect, and will be so as long as it can be
said &ldquo;We see not yet all things put under Him&rdquo;
(Heb. ii. 8). Therefore He has taught His
faithful people of every age to lift up this prayer&mdash;&ldquo;Thy
Kingdom come&rdquo;&mdash;that it may be
brought to pass that He may rule in all hearts
supreme; that the lands which are still heathen
may be brought into His Kingdom; and that
those who now profess to bear His Name may
be &ldquo;Saints&rdquo; indeed. And inasmuch as He
&ldquo;loved the Church and gave Himself for it,&rdquo;
not that it might consist of so-called Christians&mdash;who
in heart are worshippers of Mammon, and
not subjects of the Crucified&mdash;but &ldquo;that He
might sanctify and cleanse it with the washing
of water and the word, that it should be holy
and without blemish,&rdquo; this prayer&mdash;&ldquo;Thy Kingdom
come&rdquo;&mdash;must continue to ascend until He
can &ldquo;present it to Himself a glorious Church,
not having spot or wrinkle or any such thing&rdquo;
(Eph. v. 25-27). And then at last the cry will
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[Pg&nbsp;165]</a></span>
be raised, &ldquo;The Kingdoms of this world are
become the Kingdoms of our Lord, and of His
Christ, and He shall reign for ever and ever&rdquo;
(Rev. xi. 15).</p>

<p>We are taught in Holy Scripture that faith
can move mountains of difficulty (S. Matt. xvii.
20), and that the prayer of faith has a power
to which God has set no bounds (S. Matt.
xxi. 22). And the surest way to pray in faith
is to be ourselves striving for the fulfilment of
our prayers.</p>

<p>Now the King Himself declared the source
from which the weakness of His Kingdom would
arise. When He prayed for His little band of
disciples, He added, &ldquo;Neither pray I for these
alone, but for them also which shall believe on
me through their word; that they all may be
one; as Thou, Father, art in Me, and I in Thee,
that they also may be one in us: that the world
may believe that Thou hast sent Me&rdquo; (S. John
xvii. 20, 21). Consequently if we would gain an
answer to our prayer, &ldquo;Thy Kingdom come,&rdquo; we
want to lead Christian men to think that the
saying is true, &ldquo;A Kingdom divided against
itself cannot stand&rdquo; (S. Mark iii. 24); and that
it is impossible for &ldquo;The Kingdom of Heaven&rdquo;
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[Pg&nbsp;166]</a></span>
to be strong to win souls for Christ, whilst its
subjects are forming factions and so-called denominations,
and are opposing one another.
&ldquo;Behold how good and how pleasant it is for
brethren to dwell together in unity! For there
the Lord commanded the blessing, even life for
evermore&rdquo; (Ps. cxxxiii. 1, 3).</p>

<p>To re-unite the divided branches of Christ&rsquo;s
Holy Church, or even to heal the divisions
amongst God&rsquo;s people in our own land, is a
work which is beyond the power of man to
accomplish. But if Christians would but be
persuaded to see the advantages of unity, and
to desire to live up to their high calling as
God&rsquo;s children&mdash;as the one family of God&mdash;the
first step would have been taken which would
lead, in God&rsquo;s own time, to the end in view.</p>

<p>For if the subjects of &ldquo;The Kingdom of
Heaven&rdquo; only realised their position, how great
would be the answer to this universal prayer,
&ldquo;Thy Kingdom come!&rdquo; How would Christ&rsquo;s
Kingdom be then advancing in the world! For
His Church would be moving, as one mighty
army, against His foes, and Christ in His members
would be indeed going forth, &ldquo;conquering
and to conquer&rdquo; (Rev. vi. 2).</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[Pg&nbsp;167]</a></span>
May He pardon all that is defective in these
pages, and bless them to the promotion of His
glory. May He grant that those who read them
may be strengthened in their own faith, and be
themselves prepared for the great day, when
&ldquo;The Kingdom of Heaven,&rdquo; as we know it, will
have become the Kingdom of Glory; &ldquo;when
there shall be one flock and one Shepherd&rdquo; (S.
John x. 16); and the daily repeated prayer will
have been fulfilled,</p>

<p class="center" style="padding-bottom: 2em;"><span class="smcap">Thy Kingdom come</span>.</p>

<h2><i>A Prayer for Unity.</i></h2>


<p>O God the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ,
our only Saviour, the Prince of Peace; Give us
grace seriously to lay to heart the great dangers
we are in by our unhappy divisions. Take away
all hatred and prejudice, and whatsoever else
may hinder us from godly union and concord:
that, as there is but one Body, and one Spirit,
and one Hope of our Calling, one Lord, one
Faith, one Baptism, one God and Father of us
all, so we may henceforth be all of one heart,
and of one soul, united in one holy bond of
Truth and Peace, of Faith and Charity, and
may with one mind and one mouth glorify Thee;
through Jesus Christ our Lord. <i>Amen.</i></p>
